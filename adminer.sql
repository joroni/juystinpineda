And from a point of view of someone studying law (though abroad), it is definitely harder and more complicated than as it sounds. Yes, it will need a high degree of commitment and of course your time. It can have the tendency to eat you alive and or make you want to crawl in your own hole, kill yourself and die. Well that\'s just the one extreme anyway. The other is that, like myself, I enjoy it. Yes it is boring and very tiring too but who gets tired of things you enjoy? My law school is not at the very top of the chart. I\'m not an a-list student. One thing I have is the \'dream\' and wanting to serve.\n\n\nSo I say, go for it! It may not be that easy mentally, physically, and of course financially. But if you have a way of pursuing your dream, then why not right? It doesn\'t matter how long it will take. Because once you\'re there you can stay there. I don\'t know the feeling yet but I know its definitely sweeter than just having it as a mere \'dream\'.\n\n\nLet us put the balance back.\nBecause justice is not a rich man\'s game.\n\n\nyukenduwet!',	0,	'1',	'',	'',	0,	0),

(6,	1,	'2009-06-19 16:23:21',	'2009-06-19 16:23:21',	'Le Guin\'s story made me realized that happiness has a suffering counterpart. In excess of everything, when there is too much of something, imbalance comes. The majority sets the norms and not following it will make you an underdog. In reality, it is the powerful, the rich, who controls everything. They have the authority over big deals that affect everybody else. The happy Omelasians whose values inlcude \"whatever makes you happy\" and \"live as if you will die tomorrow,\" didn\'t mind of the real issues that their place faces. Why would they mind when they are happy and contented? Why would they mind if they consider Omelas in a state of Utopia?\n\nIt\'s also proven that the world will never be balanced because that\'s how it should be lived. There will always be rich and poor people. And the tendency is, the rich will become richer and the poor will become poorer. The poor might be better or climb to the top, but how many of them will have the same ending? There will always be poverty, problems, crimes and other reasons why the world is far from being perfect.\n\nSome states like Russia and China for instance, tried to create fairness through communism. But it didn\'t work as smoothly as it can be. Although it can be said that the main goal of communism is equality for everybody, it still doesn\'t apply in the long run. As shown in the savage comedy novel Animal Farm by Orwell, it depicted in the story, Stalinist Russia as represented by Napoleon, the pig who tried to be the leader of the rebellion for freedom. The leader led the fight to freedom, but when they have attained the freedom, the greed for power went into his veins and it brought their world back in slavery. People have the tendency to be blinded by the power that they possess which should be used for good. And so the fight for equality remains a fight, a fight that might never be prevailed.\n\nThe mentally challenged child in Omelas represents the weak, voiceless, innocent and the minority. In the society, there should be somebody who should represent the \"minority.\" Seeing the defects of the child, \'they\' judged him as the outcast because he is not the same as the majority through his actions and appearance. It was exaggerated however that the mentally challenged who carried the burden of the abnormal is a child (maybe of age less than 10).&nbsp; It really represented the minority, the easily stepped on the society. And so what\'s the significance of the child? He is the reason why people of Omelas are happy. It is the child that somewhat absorbs all the mistakes of the society, becoming the sacrificial lamb, and let most people live happily.\n\nThe ones who walked away are represented by Freud\'s super ego, who cannot stand seeing the suffering of the child. They can\'t do anything about it and so they just leave. They might not also like to have a change in the status quo, a change that will involve the freedom of the child and the change for equality. In that case if it happens, chaos might occur in Omelas.\n\nHere\'s the point. In the Philippines, it is obvious that the government is corrupt. The government represents the happy people. The child is represented by those people who are victimized by the government. These are the people who pay taxes and have income exactly suited for their families. The people who walk away might be literally, those people who are leaving the Philippines and cannot stand its hopelessness for development. Of course, it is really debated whether moving out and becoming slaves in other countries is the key answer if problems cannot be solved although a lot of people claim it is the answer.\n\nWell, as far as I\'m concerned, if change is desperately needed for good things to come, then invest on it. I\'ve experienced becoming a part of a system that I consider \"corrupt\" (I have learned it was corrupt after some time). I tried first to become a part of the solution to the problem by promoting my own ideologies which I think is good and helpful. However, the rotten system didn\'t permit the change that I wanted. But that didn\'t stop me from campaigning change. Although in the end, I left and walked away like the Omelasians who can\'t stand seeing the suffering of the child, I made it a point that I challenged the remaining people to do something about the problem. They may not solve it directly, but just making them aware of what\'s happening and not tolerating the mediocrity of the system is enough to show concern for the better.\n\nSo it\'s like, do something first and if it can\'t be done then that\'s the time we say it can\'t be fixed. Or maybe if we can\'t fix it then we look for somebody who can fix it. And I\'m saying that if the \"change\" that you are promoting is something that will cause the challenge and disturbance of the status quo and might lead to critical changes in the norm, you will be willing to choose that if you really want to make the change you are fighting for. It is hard but it really takes guts to do it.\n\nSimply walking away is no difference with those who make the suffering suffer because the former and the latter both didn\'t do anything to lessen or destroy the suffering.\n\nJGP 06-20-09',	'Learning from Omelasians who walked away',	'\n				\nDoes walking away from Omelas the only answer? Should we be scared for change? How far should we fight for our principles? Looking for the answer and doing something to solve the problem is the key and just directly walking away.\n\nKey readings: Animal Farm by George Orwell, The Ones who Walk Away from Omelas by Ursula Le Guin		',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'omelasians',	'',	'',	'2019-03-06 08:11:13',	'2019-03-06 08:11:13',	'',	0,	'http://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=4',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

How do you know the difference between a dream and the real thing?\n\nBasically, the truth is what we know and proven or something that we learned from somebody we trust. The former speaks of observations that catered our minds with proofs. For instance, it is true that products sold from Divisoria are way cheaper than those in the malls based from the argument “Divisoria products are cheaper or more expensive.” With your personal encounter buying from the mall and Divisoria, you’ve proven the tautology that it is cheaper and existing by going and seeing it for yourself. In the latter, on the other hand, truth is based from the influence of one who has authority and the one you trust and believe in. When your mother, a person you truly trust because she decides for all of your actions during your childhood, says that the neighbor is evil, even without saying any explanation, you will believe it. It’s a matter of influence and credibility. Although the representation of yourself is a microcosm of a bigger scope in society, still it applies. That’s how the truth is handled yet the latter explanation can be disregarded sometimes due to some reasons (i.e. if your mother is proven to be a liar).\n\nSometimes the truth becomes subjective based on the vantage point of the person. If you were asked “What was the emotion of the person in front of you?” and you say happy because you see the person smiling, it is truth for you. However, when the friend of this person is asked about the emotion of this person, and since the friend knows that the person has problems and sad even if the person is smiling, she will say that the person is sad. That is the truth for the friend and that’s the “more truth.”\n\n“Let’s capture the dream.” – Chazz Michael Michaels, Blades of Glory\n\nA dream can either be something you want to happen in your life or events that happen during unconsciousness period. How is it different from a real thing? Of course, when you dream, sometimes you dream of improbable things to happen like you can fly or you have super powers and the like. One thing that is similar from both dream and reality is the emotion. Whether you are dreaming or facing reality, there is emotion and that will always be present. When you dream that somebody you love is dead or if in reality somebody you love is dead, you will be sad. But the question now is, what if it is in reality that you can do things that you can only do when dreaming? Example, you can fly and it is already the truth. How can you then classify if it’s still a dream? The answer is two words: physical feelings.\n\n2. Given the choice between the real imperfect world and the virtual perfect world, what would you prefer? Why?\n\nWho would like to live in a perfect world but those who are boring? Life is meaningful and sensible because of the risks and imperfection of it. Although of course sometimes life becomes full of imperfection like some sort of series of unfortunate events but that’s the essence of it. If we live in a perfect, everybody’s rich and happy always. People don’t have problems and they don’t have any challenges. This world is only good for people who want to play safe. These people who play safe are people who won’t improve because it’s just senseless. So the answer is real imperfect world. Hence, who would like to live in a “virtual world?” It sounds phony.\n\n3. Define truth. Why do you think people struggle to know the truth? What\'s the point of knowing the truth?\n\n“The truth shall prevail.” – The Philippine Star\n\nTruth is the interpretation of fact as what I’ve explained in question number 1. The truth is, truth hurts that’s why people struggle to know it. A lot of people are scared of the truth and so they tend not to know it or even try to alter it. One truth that all people know is the truth that we will all die. At some point, I, you and everybody else will die. Now, other people can’t accept it especially when someone they love so much dies. They know the truth about death yet they want to avoid it because it hurts. The whole point why we should know the truth is that it sets us free. That’s why justice existed because people want to know the truth whether or not others don’t like to know or try to alter it. Example there is a massive cheating in an election, justice for the truth to be prevailed is essential because the truth will dictate the future of the people. And so in other aspects.\n\nJGP 7-5-09		',	'Interview by Amanda Fernandez for Philosophy of Person subject',	'\n				The interview is a requirement for Amanda\'s subject.

We can only determine that when we die.  There are people who believe that there is life after death. As such, there is heaven where good people go while hell for the bad people. Other people believe otherwise. Those who don\'t believe in life after death say that after we die, our bodies decay and that\'s the end of us.\n\nIn one of the Apologetics session I attended, the arguments for life after death are given and explained point per point. Although I\'m already a believer of life after death with just faith, I found a concrete justification that there is really life after death.\n\nIn a Christian perspective, the icon used is Jesus Christ, who was crucified, died and resurrected. He can be an example. Also, there is a distinction of body and soul. When we die, it is said that the body decays but the soul doesn\'t. The soul stays alive when we die and is put to our resurrection bodies later on when we live again (for judgment day).\n\nHaving established that there is a difference between a body and soul, it can be given a possibility that there is really life after death.  But more importantly, the reason why I\'m very convinced that there is really life after death is justice. In this world, there are poor and there are rich.. There are good and bad people. I agree with the argument that is unfair to put just an end to a person who is bad (like Hitler) after making others suffer. In the same way, it is unfair for a poor person to be poor in his lifetime because of uncontrollable unfortunate events. I personally believe that the other life becomes the place for justice to all people. This argument is very strong and I think this makes life after death alive.\n\nSo for those who don\'t believe in it, they can do whatever they want. However, there is always justice that will take place if not in this world, in the other.

Well, I\'m not a person who is in a relationship with the same sex but I\'m currently in a relationship with the most beautiful girl I\'ve ever seen and been with. I\'ve been condemning homosexuals especially having relationships with them because for me it\'s \"ehw\" and unacceptable to society. I\'m also a closed Catholic and I believe that a man is for a woman and vice versa.\n\nWhen I fell in love with this girl last year, everything was very unexplainable. The heart does all of the moves although I was laughing at people who\'re in love way back. But the point is, I realized that love is an unexplainable feeling that a person feels towards another. Thus, the other person feels the same way too for his partner.\n\nI came up to the idea that the feeling of \"love\" may happen to homosexual couples who felt an unexplainable feeling which is mutual. People have the freedom to love and it\'s also a freedom for the homosexuals to do the same. I personally believe it\'s okay as long as they do not step on the freedom of others.\n\nThe reason why these homosexual people want to have \"marriage\" is for them to be recognized by the State as a couple and have rights which the majority of the couples have. I think the blessing of the church is not needed as long as the State will recognize them with equal rights.\n\nThe reason why there is discrimination against these homosexual and their same sex marriage is the norms of the society. But going back, why would the society dictate on your feelings to a person you really love? The society is just very conservative and close minded that\'s why they\'ve been so resistant to the issue.\n\nFor me now, it doesn\'t concern me as to whether the couple is of different or same sexes. The married couple might be of different sexes, but they can\'t make their relationship work out while the same sex couple has a successful relationship. Which is better now?\n\nI\'m not a pro-homosexual advocate and I\'m a believer of God and His word. It\'s only my personal view that love can exist not only to boy-girl but also to same sex people. And I think there\'s nothing wrong with that as long as there is love.\n\n		',	'Same sex marriage?',	'\n				I changed my view of same sex marriage after feeling love with the girl I\'ll be with for the rest of my life.

(39,	1,	'2010-09-06 14:41:28',	'2010-09-06 14:41:28',	'\n				Yesterday, the yearly bar exam in La Salle has started and a lot of people are excited. And now it\'s going near... The application for law school for the next school year has started and its entrance exam will start on October onwards. I\'ve been thinking a lot lately regarding law school, if I should push through about my dream of becoming a lawyer or just look for a job related with my undergrad course, go to abroad for a couple of years and gain experience and have a happy life. What is good with my undergrad course is that I somehow like it. It is computer science but I can end up not just doing programming the whole day and to the next years. The demand for IT people and specifically to a network engineering specialization is quite high and the compensation is good. Anywhere you go, there is demand for people with IT courses even without experience yet. I think my future is secured with my course.\n\n<strong>Why law school?</strong>\n\nMy undergrad course is not a good pre-law course and I have no background with what\'s like taking up law courses. But my realization is that in this country, there are a lot of injustices. These injustices are brought by selfishness, poverty, greed of power and other bad virtues. The rights of a lot of people are being stepped on it hurts my heart and mind seeing them like that in television, news or even in my everyday life in the society. It\'s really painful. And seeing those corrupt and bad people being put above the law and are saved from such punishment makes me angry very much. These mentioned realizations are my motivation for pursuing a law career. To help those people uphold their rights and defend them and to make those bad people get what they deserve under the law.\n\nI then started my research on the legal education in the Philippines.\n\nThere are three consistent top law schools in the Philippines namely UP, Ateneo and San Beda. Their passing records are relatively high limiting my choices to these schools. These schools also produce well known lawyers in various fields which prove that they really make good graduates. The national passing rate for lawyers is extremely low averaging around 20%.  I read some articles on law students\' experiences in law school. I learned that it\'s very hard because it\'s a very different discipline. You have to memorize a lot and you have to think critically very much all the time or else your life in the law school will end quickly.  You have to be good in public speaking and passionate in your work. You need to sacrifice a lot of your time, your social life, your free time. I also started talking to some friends who are taking up law from different schools. Almost all of them told me they\'re really struggling to survive. Some say that it\'s a lot of memorization and it\'s going to be a never ending memorization of laws. Some others say that a day is not enough to study and one got kicked and now at San Sebastian because of I don\'t know reasons.\n\nA part time law student is highly discouraged as told by current students who are taking up law stating that the study of law demands a lot of time. Chances of passing the bar are slimmer when you give less time studying (when in fact one friend even said she lacks time studying even if she\'s a full time student). But my plan is to become a part time law student and work full time in an IT company so that I can use my skill I learned in my undergrad. Also, having a full time job will give me funding for my law school.  There are schools like San Beda and UP that offer a 5-year night law program but classes are still held everyday. I realized that working from 8am-5pm and attending a law class from 6pm-9pm everyday is going to be very tiresome. Of course, I still need to study after class. So what\'s going to be left of me? There is however, a law school that offers an executive program where it holds law classes only Saturday and Sunday: Arellano Law. It is not so popular like the top 3 schools I mentioned but it produces a lot of lawyers as well. In the last CHED statistics, I saw that Arellano Law was part of the top 10 law schools in the country. By the way, their law program is good for 5 years in a trimestral system like La Salle.\n\n<strong> Talk about funding...</strong>\n\nComputing the tuition and fees for the law school, it\'s averaging around P40K per term. That\'s just the units and the misc fees. I still don\'t know about the expenses on materials which I think will also demand some attention since there are a lot of readings. Taking note of that, for a term that runs for 5 months (and 3 months for trimestral), I need to save P10K monthly. Well I think this kind of payment-saving scheme is feasible when I have work. I need some P400K to fund my whole law school ambition. And afterwards, I need to pass the bar or else, I cannot fulfill my role as a lawyer.\n\n<strong>The reality of the Philippine justice system</strong>\n\nFirst, as I researched, one of the reasons why the passing rate in the bar exam is very low is that there are really a vast number of laws that are implemented in the country and counting. You have to know each of them and you need to study a lot of cases. Moreover, there are strike rules by the Supreme Court that eliminate those people who have not passed the bar for several times. That\'s why becoming a lawyer is like going through the eye of a needle.\n\nSecond, after passing the bar and becoming a lawyer, what\'s next? Most lawyers practice their profession in different institutions. Others join existing law firms and others go to the academe. While new lawyers want a clean and just society, rich and greedy people have paid a lot to legal counsels to defend their unscrupulous deeds. Since they have the funds and resources and you try to defend innocent but poor and helpless people, being an ethical lawyer becomes an extra challenge. While some do the right thing, others are persuaded to be rich while stepping the fundamental essence of a lawyer. And that is evident here in the country. Even the judges are also paid if not threatened. My professor had shared some of these realities when a judge asked for a bribe to prolong the hearing of a case.  Very terrible. And this judge happens to be a law professor in a reputable law school in the country.\n\nI admire those good lawyers and judges who really dedicate their lives for the sake of justice. There are still a lot existing, though.\n\nI really want to become a lawyer someday. But I have to face reality first. I need to save money first for my law profession in the future. I want to be part of a good system and I want to go to battle  well prepared. I can help improve the country in this way. I believe.\n\nLast August 23,  the hostage crisis was due to a delay on justice in hearing the hostage taker\'s case in the Ombudsman. It is injustice or delay of justice that is the root of it. In a column in the Philippine Star I learned that a lot of trial courts pile up their cases and a lot of it are not resolved as expected. Some courts even hear cases only in the morning making the cases pile up more. It makes the statement \"Justice delayed is justice denied\" true. I remember it was also stated that the case on the Marcoses is not yet resolved and other respondents are already dead. It\'s already a 31-year old case and Imelda is now 81 y/o and a Congresswoman now.\n\nToday, September 6, the headline in the Manila Times which shook my mind is about the Ampatuan Case. Sen. Joker Arroyo said that the case might take 200 years before it\'s resolved because of so many respondents, witnesses etc. And knowing that the defense panel has been trying to delay the hearing, can justice still be served?\n\nI want to learn about the law and I want to correct a rotten system so that peace can be attained. I want to be a part of the solution. Soon.

(44,	1,	'2010-09-09 16:56:36',	'2010-09-09 16:56:36',	'For this entry, I consider this much of a social issue because a school is a microcosm of a country or the outside world so to speak.\n\nThis is not an attack towards the members of the academe who try to implement guiding rules and regulations to put standards in the education. This is just a wake up call to the people who are on top of the academic ladder. This is for those who should be protecting the sanctity of quality education one school has to offer. While I\'m not an excellent student with regard to my grades (which the system itself forced me not to believe that intelligence is not based on academic merits), it is ad hominem to say that I\'m not capable of pinpointing mishaps on overlooked academic practices.\n\n<strong>High Grades = I\'m intelligent </strong>\n\nOf my more than four years stay in the University, I found and met different professors, of ranks, age, specialization etc. I have witnessed how they teach. Some are strict. Some are passionate. Some are lenient. &nbsp;Some are diligent. Some don\'t care. &nbsp;Some are lazy. Some don\'t teach. If you\'re to ask a student regarding preferences on professor, he will probably say that he likes a professor who can easily be talked to and quite lenient and a person who gives high grades. That\'s what the students want mostly. They tend to avoid those strict may it be regarding attendance or in academic requirements. They want to learn maybe not too much and pass or get high grades easily. This is a typical observation that can be inferred as a person or student who prioritizes his survival in school and will do anything to remain standing.\n\nAs I mentioned, I don\'t really believe that grades are the basis of your intelligence. It\'s just numbers although it is a key factor somewhat. Still, these are just numbers. I remember when I was in fourth year HS when our very remarkable academic institution was preparing for its 30th year anniversary. They were seeking students to perform in a musical play in the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo for its foundation day. Of course, since it was an academic institution, we all focused on academics. So there were a few who wanted to become part of this musical event. But the much misplaced cunning of the school administration, they decided to \"award\" &nbsp;those people who will join the musical play rehearsals instead of studying. It was a big play so practice for it would take months. If a student joins the musical play, there will be additional points to be given in subjects such as science, math English etc. Other non-academic requirements need not to be passed anymore because of exemption. A lot of students took that offer where you won\'t study yet you\'re going to get high grades. Amazing isn\'t it? There were a few of us who stayed and continued to get the education we deserved. But the teachers were also part of the musical play and teaching us was quite an additional load. Hence, they canceled the classes so why teach? They stopped teaching and said to wait until those CCP partcipants finish their play before they can start teaching again so that we all get the education we deserve without a few getting advance. So what did we do during the times when we had to take the class? Just played a lot of games. But during the exams, we needed to take them all. But of course, those who participated in the CCP event got additional points for their hardwork.\n\nWhere is the essence of quality education then based on academic merit?\n\nLater on I realized that the give-me-grade-so-I-can-be-called-intelligent is a pandemic. That\'s why those people who get high grades don\'t really mean that they\'re really intelligent. There\'s always politics in numbers. These things can always be fabricated in that sense.\n\n<strong>School is my second home</strong>\n\nSince a child spends most of his childhood life in school, educators say that the school is a person\'s second home. Interestingly in the Philippines, to get a good second home comes with a price. If you can pay, you get a good second home with nice facilities. Otherwise, just be a good person. Interestingly, a lot of schools try their best to show the goodness of their institution. They invest on facilities and faculty to attract students. Anyway, when I first heard of the Henry Sy Hall that DLSU is planning to build, I smiled because of the facility that school will build to cater services for the students. But when I learned that a \"mall\" will be built in the midst of the university, I really got literally angry. The school or the sponsor will spend P1.4 billion for a 15-floor building. What are the contents of that building? Study areas? Classrooms? etc etc. These facilities are already existing in the first place. And what will happen to the existing facilities that are overlapped? Destroy it? My goodness. This action now questions the motives of the school. Dr. Nuncio commented on my FB status and said \"Edifice complex.\" And for me it\'s the right term that describes what the school is doing. I won\'t further elaborate on my arguments versus the school\'s plan on erecting a very expensive building. But the bottomline, isn\'t the building just for aesthetics? I again remembered my high school when they decided to build a big chapel. We were all asking the admin to first provide a gym because it can be used everyday by all students. But they decided to build a big chapel for first Friday masses and baccalaureate masses. Edifice complex.\n\n<strong>Teachers are powerful. Students are not.</strong>\n\nIn La Salle, when it is time for class and the student comes in late, he is marked late. When a student misses a classes, he gets zero for the day. When a student uses his cellphone and is caught while in class, he is sent to Discipline Office and gets penalize. But when the mentioned scenarios are made by the professor, nothing bad happens to him. When you try to fight for your right, your respondent professor is avenged by his professor friend and tries to get back to you to another class you are taking. This is reality and this is true. There are a lot of complaints of biased professors who grade low on papers whose opinions oppose theirs even if they say that there are no right or wrong answers. But what can the students do? Complain then what? There is no equality between teachers and students because they are distinct. However the powerful can be abusive. The powerless if not treated equally is always oppressed. It\'s very easy for a professor to give a 0.0 than for a student to have his professor get fired for his incompetency and unbecoming of a faculty.\n\n<strong>My school is popular. Yours is where the hell is that?</strong>\n\nAccording to the modern philosopher Foucault in his writing \"Questions on Geography\", he explained the vital role of a location in getting power. In relation to schools, it\'s the same concept. When a regular student from DLSU applies for a work and then a student from Zamboanga Polytechnic University who graduated Magna Cum Laude applies for the same position, the job will be more likely given to the Lasallian. That\'s true and we have to face it. But for me, I\'ve been in La Salle and saw the imperfections of the school. Many times, I realize that it\'s still up to the person to prove himself that he is rightful and worthy for the position he is aiming for and not the school. But it\'s hard still especially if you came from some never before heard school.\n\n<strong>Cogito Ergo Sum</strong>\n\nAll those misused symbolisms of education I mentioned are just realities that we face. But there are a lot more. The principles, however, of these things are still essential. Grades really check how you fare in a particular topic. Schools really need good facilities to provide good education. There is really a clear distinction between a teacher and a student. Quality schools stand out against those who don\'t perform best. The problem is, these things are exaggerated very much and misuse. What happens? The purpose of it becomes nonsense. People who are in higher learning should review these things and do something about it. I\'m no expert in education. I\'m just a victim of these scenarios and maybe a lot of people too. But as what I\'m seeing now is to be like St. La Salle- a man who dedicated his life for education. If all the teachers are like St. La Salle, there won\'t be grade-bribes or overly-expensive facilities or even abusive professors or discriminating schools. Everything will be as expected: fair, happy, conducive for learning and simple.\n\n<strong>\n</strong>',	'Talk shit in academe etiquette',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'talk-shit-in-academe-etiquette',	'',	'',	'2019-03-06 07:46:44',	'2019-03-06 07:46:44',	'',	0,	'http://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=44',	0,	'post',	'',	3),

If you don\'t earn well then you can\'t stand living in the country.\n\nIn the recent nursing board exams, only 33% or 30,000 out of the 90,000 passed the exams. Is there an available 30,000 jobs for those who passed the board exams? How about for those 60,000 who didn\'t pass? This is the face of the population vs. the job opportunities in the country. I won\'t further state facts of unemployment and population problems of the country because it\'s not the main theme of this essay. But the result of these problems lead to the rising of mushroom-sprouting networking companies whose main objective is to introduce unknown products to the country and try to \"help\" un/employed, lazy or anybody to get money through sales.\n\nWhat is very interesting about this business practice (is this really a legit practice?) is the fact the you\'ll earn even if you\'re not doing anything. This is the premise that these companies will tell you once you\'ve been oriented. Of course, who would want to earn without moving a single thing? Everybody I suppose. These businesses are starting to grow and most of them are located in Ortigas, Mandaluyong or San Juan.\n\n<strong>Interesting Ads</strong>\n\nSometime in the late 2009, I started looking for part time jobs in the Internet that I could possibly do without outweighing my studies. Anyway, back to the story. I saw the ad regarding working just 3-5 hours a day and getting P3K-5K a week or more. They showed the check amounting to their profit and said it\'s our choice to be rich and some more quotes from some rich businessmen in the world etc etc. I was really persuaded by this advertisement and sent an SMS. There were several numbers I sent an SMS to. Some replied while some don\'t. I thought the job was an office work because the ad said the company has an office somewhere. Then I asked if I needed to bring my CV and if I should wear formal attire for interview. The recruiter replied that I don\'t need to bring anything. I asked about the nature of the work and the reply was, \"Just come here so you would know. That\'s how it goes.\" Well, it\'s not burdensome to go to SM Megamall after class to see their orientation. After all, I needed a break from school.\n\nWhen I went there, the girl said that the meeting place was near the Megatrade Hall at the top floor. The girl looked like the same of my age and around her lingering near the convention center were teenagers and students who\'re also part of their company. She introduced herself and asked me to be \"open-minded\" with what I\'m about to see. So we went to the company\'s rented convention center and as I walked to the halls of my supposedly part time work, I saw people with numbers I can\'t imagine listening to the talk. I guess there were about 600 or more invited to be part of the company with 95% of it were students and teenagers. And that\'s where I learned that some companies do promote never before heard and seen beauty products, herbal products and health products, coffee and other health supplements as well which seem to be good because it\'s legal and approved by the BFAD.\n\n<strong>The good, the bad and the ugly</strong>\n\nAny company that wants to get rich will do its best to sell their products. Fair enough. These networking companies will try different marketing strategies to make their products known. And as how I see it, selling government-approved products are legal and thus should be competing with the industry. If there is a better and effective product then it should be supported to cope up with the mainstream. Hence, most networking products are soap, shampoo, coffee, tea, lotion and other stuff that we use everyday.\n\nThe problem lies on how these sales agents try to market these products to attract customers and \"business partners.\" First thing I hate about this networking system is the fact that these sales agents/recruiters are pretend-to-be-clean liars. They won\'t tell you exactly what their purpose is and the nature of the business. Instead, they will tell you vague and misleading statements like, \"we will expand the businesses of some multinational company bla bla bla.\" That\'s how they are trained- to deceive people even in the subtlest way possible.\n\nThe second problem in their recruitment is the way they convince their potential business partners of the benefits they will gain when they join the business. During my stay in that convention center in Megamall, which that company has been renting for quite sometime already, the promoter and recruiter continuously bashed the education system in the country and how life sucks even if you successfully finish a degree. I remembered their top salesman who said that he just graduated from some school in Recto. Then he asked, \"Who among you are graduates from La Salle?\" Of course I didn\'t raise my hand because I knew what\'s going to happen next. He further asked, \"If I were in an interview together with a Lasallian, who do you think will be accepted?\" Then the people angrily said, \"La Salle!\" And the rest was a hasty generalization made by him- that only from La Salle or Ateneo gets the decent job with decent pay.\n\nHe kept on lambasting the future of the Filipinos. He said that we study from age 4 to 20. Our parents spend millions for us to have a quality education. Then he said that when we graduate, we\'ll earn around P20K  or less monthly. He further subrtacted expenses like food, rent, load, taxes etc. and concluded that for forty years, we won\'t be able to save enough to become millionaires. He said that in an office, you have a boss. You also have to work 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week.\n\nAfter killing the importance of education and destroying the hopes of their future, he will start giving them hope. He said that by joining their company, everything will change. Because of investing to the right business, we can be rich people without the need of having a diploma. We can be rich by becoming business partners, not reporting to any boss and flexible to work at any time we want. Now who doesn\'t want that?\n\nThe third problem in this recruitment is that they are making everything in the state of utopia when in fact, it\'s not. They said that you just have to invest P7K to buy the products worth P20K and after selling it, your capital is regained and you\'ll have instant money. Thus, if you have recruited people then you\'ll have a commission from their sales which adds up to your income without doing anything.\n\nAn example that the company gave was a branded toothpaste. The recruiter said that the branded toothpaste invested millions for advertisement and other costs to distribute the products and other expenses. To profit from such investment, the company needed to increase the price of the branded toothpaste so that they can have their investment back. For a networking company, the advertisement and distribution costs are done by yourself. Therefore in essence, the payment that should supposedly given to celebrities for advertisement and other costs will be handed straight to you. This is what they call the linear method of business. If you buy a lot of products from them, and continue to recruit people under you, it\'s possible that you\'ll earn millions monthly.\n\nThe last problem of this networking business is their over sales talk skills and unsolicited pieces of advice. Even when you say \"NO\" to them or \"I\'ll think about it,\" they will go very personal and ask about your family and how you can help them. Others will continue to make arrangements such as you can sell your cellphone or other gadgets to have the money to buy their products. I remembered when I told them I still need to consult my parents about it and they said that I shouldn\'t ever tell my parents about it because they are biased in saying that it\'s just a pyramid scam and won\'t let me continue. Hence until now since last year, that recruiter still is sending me SMS to join their \"business.\"\n\n<strong>Factual realizations</strong>\n\nI personally think that there\'s nothing wrong selling products like direct sales. There are known companies that do that even if their products are sold in the malls. Of course, that\'s one way of making money. That\'s precisely what networking companies do. But the rest of their principles are very unethical, unprofessional and deceitful. First and foremost, how can somebody believe in you if you don\'t tell them exactly what the company is all about. Saying that the work is \"expanding the businesses of multinational companies here in the country\" is very different from saying that it is networking. If you\'re beating around the bush and saying vague things, then you\'re lying to your clients. And what kind of business is that? If in the first place you lie in the introduction, what\'s the assurance that the things you say about the products are true? This is not an observation for a single incident. This lying is seen even in social networking sites. They will show you pictures of checks but they won\'t say the real background of their business. Instead they will give you vague descriptions that are very misleading. You know why they don\'t tell the truth? Because that\'s what they\'re taught and learned in the trainings they had so that the clients won\'t back out.\n\nAlso, destroying the fact that education is important is very bad. I was able to talk to some \"entrepeneurs\" who have invested in networking and they\'re brainwashed that education won\'t do good. Sadly, some of them even enroll to school not to study but to find new recruits. How bad can that be? Although they have the money, some even have already bought expensive cars from their recruits. But I mean, a lot of them are even younger than me and have been lying to their parents that they are in school. It\'s not about money anymore but values as well.\n\nIf you are convinced that investing in networking will make you a millionaire then think again. It\'s not true that you will be a millionaire in an instant. That\'s just full bull shit. What if you are not able to sell those products for a simple reason that it is not popular and some are even more expensive than the market price for its counterpart products? Remember, popular brands are tried and tested while networking products are unknown and other ingredients used although approved by BFAD are hard to explain because it\'s very technical and scientific. Also, what if you are unable to recruit people under your pyramid? How are you supposed to become a millionaire? As far as I know, it\'s not easy to find people who are interested to invest P7K or more for unknown products to sell.\n\nThe reality is this: It\'s still hard to become rich even with this kind of system. The people who are becoming richer and richer are those people who have started the networking and the ones who are on the topmost part of the pyramid. That\'s because for every recruit under him/her, he has a part there. So if this continues and you take part of it, he still has commission on the sales that you have because it\'s a chain from top to bottom. The question now is, who becomes rich? When will you become rich? Who is being deceived now?\n\nIf you are not able to sell and recruit, that\'s where the lying and deceiving start. You start to look for people to join you to have a part of their sales as well like those who are on the top. That\'s where the over exaggerated sales talk comes in as well. Instead of being more productive in school or in the work you are specializing in, you are stressed to find recruits. How bull shit is that.\n\nI believe that their arguments have a point as well like it\'s really hard to look for a job with a decent pay. But networking is not the answer. If it were the solution then we should all be doing that. It\'s still hardwork. It boils down now to how creative and resourceful we should be in order to attain what we dream of. It\'s not easy to be rich if you\'re starting from scratch but it\'s possible with the right and ethical steps. Now if you are convinced to join their utopia then go ahead. It\'s for you to find out that it\'s just a big mess.\n\n(scam definition from <a href=\"http://dictionary.com\">http://dictionary.com</a>)		',	'Valuing the real deal in networking scam',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'valuing-the-real-deal-in-networking-scam',	'',	'',	'2010-10-28 04:20:53',	'2010-10-28 04:20:53',	'',	0,	'http://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=47',	0,	'post',	'',	1),

This module is very important for standardization of logs gathered for network monitoring.   The module is adaptable to other projects that need normalization or topics related to that.\n\n<strong>Some prerequisites</strong>\n\nThere are some lessons required to learn to be able to understand this article although level of knowledge doesn\'t have to be very advanced. These include: object oriented programming,  basic syntax in C#<strong>, </strong>dynamic loading. In order to follow the article per se, C# should be installed in a Windows platform.\n\n<strong>Brief background re AdLCIM</strong>\n\nOur thesis AdLCIM is basically a networking monitoring tool that accepts logs coming from different network devices in a LAN. The system collects the logs and analyzes them. But before the logs are analyzed, the logs must be put in a standardized form. Although the logs that are sent to the system have a format (Syslog format thru <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3164.txt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RFC 3164</a>), the message still differs from one device to another due to device type or proprietary differences. This makes the role of the Log Normalizer Module very essential. If the system can standardize the log collected in a way that the user can easily understand then it will be very helpful to monitor the whole network. And since the system is adaptable to new devices, the system can be useful in future deployments/updates/versions by just creating new normalizers. To cut the story short, the standardized logs are summarized and correlated. The logs are classified as normal, attack or alerts logs. The attack logs are handled by an incident manager while alert logs are given recommendations to be resolved.\n\n<strong>Building Device Normalizers</strong>\n\nThe research paper we made regarding the normalization of logs can be seen before the start of this article although it\'s very boring to read. I just put it for reference. Anyway, a very important characteristic of the AdLCIM is that it is adaptable to new devices. This means that it should also be adaptable to standardization of new devices. But of course, handling new devices should not require the system to be rebuilt again for the sake of the new device. The program for the new device should be the only one compiled so it can connect to the system. To solve the issue, the use of dynamic loading is necessary. In this sense, dynamic loading is the ability to run a program together with a newly deployed program (connected together) without recompiling the original system.\n\nIn the Visual C# environment, some necessary configurations must be done in order to invoke dynamic loading. Here are some necessary codes:\n<blockquote><span style=\"color:#000080;\">using System.Reflection;</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\">public static Object FindNormalizer(string AssemblyName,</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> string ClassName, string MethodName, Object[] args)</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> {</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> // Load Assembly</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> Assembly assembly = Assembly.LoadFrom(AssemblyName);</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> // Get Class</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> foreach (Type type in assembly.GetTypes())</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> {</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> if (type.IsClass == true)</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> {</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> if (type.FullName.EndsWith(\".\" + ClassName))</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> {</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> // Activate Class</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> object ClassObj = Activator.CreateInstance(type);</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> // Dynamically Invoke the method</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> object Result = type.InvokeMember(MethodName,</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> BindingFlags.Default | BindingFlags.InvokeMethod,</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> null,</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> ClassObj,</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> args);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> return (Result);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> }</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> }</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> }</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> throw (new System.Exception(\"Could not invoke method\"));</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> }</span></blockquote>\nThe code shown above is the code use to invoke dynamic loading. In the first line you will see the library used so that assemblies can be called- System.Reflection. This library is capable of invoking and manipulating dynamically linked classes although we won\'t be digging deeper on its other functionalities but its more or less its major function.\n\nThe FindNormalizer method has 4 parameters: Assembly name, Class name, Method and Parameters. This is a very easy to analyze since any source code has a file name (Assembly name), class, method and parameters. These are the main considerations that you have supply in order to invoke something dynamically. Once it is supplied with the necessary contents, the dynamically loaded program will be run when the method FindNormalizer is called with its fields filled.\n\n<strong>Classifying Normalizer Type</strong>\n\nWhen the AdLCIM is run<strong>, </strong>it accepts logs from network devices but from recognized ones. Meaning if a device tries to send logs but it is not recognized in the database then no log is recorded. A recognized device is a device given with proper identification such as a hostname, device type, device specification and device details. An example can be the laptop I\'m using right now. Its hostname is Plato-DaAcademy, device type is COMPUTER, device specification is WINDOWS and device detail is 7. This process is required to other devices to be able to have its logs recorded to the database.\n\nThe importance of identifying devices is for you to know what devices you\'re monitoring. Getting logs from unrecognized devices may bring confusion to log analysis. Thus, if there\'s no device identification then all devices can just send logs though not necessary for monitoring. Another reason is for normalization process. It will be explained in the next paragraph.\n\nAs seen in the first code above, the FindNormalizer method has 4 parameters. The first parameter is the assembly name or the file name of the normalizer to be opened. The assembly name is classified based on the device type and device specification of the hostname that wants to send a log. So for example, the hostname Plato-DaAcademy (from previous example) tries to send a log. The system will look for the device type and device specification of Plato-DaAcademy and after that, its assembly name can be classified. For this example the device type and device specification are COMPUTER and WINDOWS. Therefore the assembly name that will be opened is \"COMPUTER_WINDOWS_NORMALIZER.dll.\"\n\nThe second parameter is the class name, which is the same as the format for the assembly name. Therefore the class name for the previous example is still COMPUTER_WINDOWS.  The third parameter is the method which in the system it is standardize as \"Normalize.\" All devices have a method \"Normalize\" which literally normalizes a log based on the standard imposed on them. The fourth parameter is the parameter of the method which is an object because there can be multiple parameters of different data types.\n\nBelow is a normalizer for an Intrusion Detection System called Snort.\n<blockquote><span style=\"color:#000080;\">using System;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\">using System.Collections.Generic;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\">using System.Text;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\">using System.IO;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\">using LogNormalizer;</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\">namespace LogNormalizer</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\">{</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> class IDS_SNORT_NORMALIZER : SuperNormalizer</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> {</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> static string searchNormalizeAttack(string attackMessage)</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> {</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> int bCheck = 0;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> string readLine, attackNotFound = \"OTHERS\";</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> int checkComma, checkCompare;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> string checkOriginal, normalizedAttackMessage;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(\"c:\\\\AdLCIM_SnortNormalizedAttacks.txt\");</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> while (bCheck == 0)</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> {</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> readLine = sr.ReadLine();</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> Console.WriteLine(readLine);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> checkComma = readLine.IndexOf(\',\');</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> checkOriginal = readLine.Substring(0, checkComma);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> Console.WriteLine(checkOriginal);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> checkCompare = String.Compare(attackMessage, checkOriginal);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> //Console.WriteLine(checkCompare);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> if (checkCompare == 0)</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> {</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> normalizedAttackMessage = readLine.Remove(0, checkComma + 2);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> Console.WriteLine(normalizedAttackMessage);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> Console.WriteLine(\"END\");</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> bCheck = 1;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> sr.Close();</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> return normalizedAttackMessage;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> }</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> else if (sr.EndOfStream)</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> {</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> bCheck = 1;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> sr.Close();</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> return attackNotFound;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> }</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> }</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> sr.Close();</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> return attackNotFound;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> }</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> public static string parseSyslog(string SnortMessage)</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> {</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> try</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> {</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> string normalizedSnortMessage;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> string getNormalizeAttackNow;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> int result, result2, result3, result4, result5, result6, result7, result8, result9;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> string message, message2, message3, message4, message5, message6;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> string attackMessage, protocol, srcIP, srcPort, destIP, destPort;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> string returnMe = \"OTHERS\";</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> result = SnortMessage.IndexOf(\']\');</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> // Console.WriteLine(result);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> message = SnortMessage.Remove(0, result);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> //Console.WriteLine(message);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> result2 = message.IndexOf(\' \');</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> message2 = message.Remove(0, result2 + 1);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> //Console.WriteLine(message2);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> result3 = message2.IndexOf(\'[\');</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> attackMessage = message2.Substring(0, result3);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> attackMessage = attackMessage.Substring(0, attackMessage.Length -

The program is dynamically invoked once a hostname with a type IDS and specification SNORT tries to send a log.  The Normalize method has 5 parameters which will all be used for normalization. The ParseSyslog method is responsible for fixing the logs into a standardized format. The searchNormalizeAttack method on the other hand has a text file where in all possible attacks are seen and its standardized naming convention is found. An example log coming from a SNORT IDS is:\n<blockquote><span style=\"color:#000080;\">snort: [1:100000:0] THE BACKDOOR TINI HAS BEEN DETECTED [Classification: A Network Trojan was Detected] [Priority: 1] {TCP} 172.16.4.106:1050 -&gt; 172.16.4.101:7777</span></blockquote>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">After passing through the IDS_SNORT_NORMALIZER.dll, the log becomes:</span></span>\n<blockquote><span style=\"color:#000080;\">TINI, TCP, 172.16.4.106, 1050, 172.16.4.101, 7777</span></blockquote>\n<span style=\"color:#000080;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The log is now standardized into a format with- Attack Name, Protocol Type, Src IP, Src Port, Dest IP, Dest Port. This is the standardized log format for all IDS may it be SNORT or other IDS. So for instance, there\'s a new IDS called \"YATCO IDS\" and it has different format, then an IDS_YATCO_NORMALIZER.dll must be created in order to make the log look like the standardized log.

I also suggest this book for people who have been skeptic in the Christian faith most especially in Jesus\' existence. This book presents different evidences like those presented in court in order to prove the existence and works of Jesus.</p>\n<p>I will be sharing a chapter that was discussed in the book which I reported during the apologetics session of <a href=\"http://www.ccsformdev.com/\">FORMDEV</a>. The chapter\'s entitled, \"The Corroborating Evidence.\"</p>\n<p>The definition of corroborate is to make more certain or confirm. The chapter talks about different people during the early times (or the time of Jesus) who intentionally or accidentally mentioned the works of the Lord in their daily lives. For instance, Josephus, a first century historian born on AD 37 created a book called Antiquities. This is a history of the Jews from the creation until his time. A section there called <a href=\"http://jewishchristianlit.com/Topics/JewishJesus/josephus.html\">Testimonium Flavianum</a> talks about the life, miracles, death and resurrection of Jesus. Although some of his works may have been interpolated, it still summarizes the events that happen in the life of Jesus. The corroboration of Josephus is very important since his citing of events are accurate with the correctness of his record on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_War\">Jewish War</a>.</p>\n<p>Another corroborator is <a href=\"http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/historianstacitus/a/Tacitus.htm\">Tacitus</a>, who was a senator and a Roman historian. In his works, he mentioned that Nero persecuted the Christians in AD 115.  He also mentioned Christus, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition. This previous statement corroborates to the existence of Jesus and that He suffered the extreme penalty which was crucifixion (during his time). He also mentioned the most mischievous superstition which was the spread of Christianity. How can you explain then the spread of a religion based on the worship of a man who had suffered the most ignominious death possible?</p>\n<p>Some Jewish accounts also corroborate to the existence of Jesus. According to the Talmud, Jesus was referred to as false messiah who did magic and justly condemned to death. He was born from a Roman soldier and Mary with an unusual birth. Although of course it was written in their point of view, it still corroborates to the events that happened in the life of Jesus like unsual birth (born from a virgin), false messiah (He is the messiah), did magic (miracles) and condemend to death. In the Jewish literature, Jesus was regarded to as a teacher with disciples and a heretic deceiver. This corroborates to the existence of Jesus\' apostles and followers.</p>\n<p>There are also people corroborated the time when the day went dark after Jesus died. In the book made by <a href=\"http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/thallus.html\">Thalus</a>, it was written that there was darkness after the crucifixion of Jesus and he speculated that it was an eclipse. <a href=\"http://www.tertullian.org/readfirst.htm\">Tertullian</a> aslo corroborated by stating that there was an eclipse visible in Rome, Athens and other Mediterranean cities. Phlegon in his book, corroborated in specifically that on the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad (i.e., 33 A.D.) there was \"the greatest eclipse of the sun\" and that \"it became night in the sixth hour of the day [i.e., noon] so that stars even appeared in the heavens. This statement is very straightforward to corroborate the event written in the bible. </p>\n<p> What I mentioned above is an excerpt of the Case for Christ. I just put some explanation to make it more understandable. But the point of the chapter and the rest of the book is that the Holy Bible is not just a piece of book where stories are written. The events recorded there are true. Therefore, since there are corroborating evidences that confirm the events in the bible then the bible is also a history book not just stories or myths.  Remember, the corroborating evidences come from documents not only from Christian but even those opposing Christianity.</p>\n<p>Most of the skeptics don\'t consider the bible as a source of history. But removing the bible as a source, other records will say that:</p>\n<p>a. Jesus was a Jewish teacher<br />\nb. People believed that he performed healings and exorcisms<br />\nc. Some people believed he was the Messiah<br />\nd. He was rejected by the Jewish leaders<br />\ne. He was crucified under Pontius Pilate in the reign of Tiberius<br />\nf. Despite this shameful death, his followers, who believed that he was still alive spread beyond Palestine so that there were multitudes of them in Rome by A.D. 64<br />\ng. All kinds of people from the cities and countryside-men and women, slave and free-worshiped him as God</p>\n<p>It still proves the exisitence and works of the Lord Jesus Christ. So if you are very factual and a person who needs to see to believe then you this should answer your questions. And the rest, I recommend you to read the book and it\'s for you to judge.</p>\n		',	'Learning from the Case for Christ',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'learning-from-the-case-for-christ',	'',	'',	'2010-11-01 06:46:55',	'2010-11-01 06:46:55',	'',	0,	'http://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=67',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

Pinipilit kong sanaying magsulat sa wikang banyaga upang maipaalam sa buong mundo sa pamamagitan ng lengguwaheng unibersal ang aking mga saloobin, obserbasyon at opinyon. Subalit, sadyang hindi kayang iparamdam sa sanaysay na ito ang aking tunay na nararamdaman kung hindi sa sariling wika ito isusulat. Mas maipaparating ko ito ng buong-buo.\n\nKaya heto na... kamakailan lamang, halos gusto ko nang iluwa ang aking pagiging Kristiyano at ipaglaban ang aking paniniwala at prinsipyo sa pamamagitan ng dahas at maanghang na pananalita laban sa mga mapang-api at walang kakwenta-kwentang mga taong sana\'y magbibigay hustisya sa mga taong nangangailangan nito. Hindi ko talaga maintindihan kung bakit hindi matuto-tuto ang mga Pilipino. Ang ibang minsa\'y nasubsob sa ilalim at nagsimulang umangat ay tila kinalimutan na ang nakaraan at napakadali nang tapak-tapakan ang mga taong nasa ilalim na nila.\n\nBakit may mga taong pilit lamunin lahat ng ganid upang kamalin ang umaapaw na kapangyarihan kahit na wala ng ilulugar sa kanilang busog na busog na tiyan na punong-puno ng kasamaan? Kung sino na ang wala sila pa ang kukuhanan samantalang wala nang ilulugar ang mga kung ano-anong nasa kanila na.\n\nAng batas ay nilikha upang magkaroon ng kaayusan sa isang partikular na komunidad. Ang mga ito ay nilikha ng mga taong may hustong kaalaman upang mapaigting ang kapayapaan ng lugar. Ito ay dapat na sinusunod at ang lumabag nito ay haharap sa karampatang parusa. Ngunit paano kung ang mismong mga gumawa ng mga batas ang hindi sumusunod sa mga ito at sa katunayan, mismong ang kabaligtaran nito ang kanilang ginagawa? At dahil nga sila ang nasa kapangyarihan, ang mga binalikong mga batas ay siya na ngayong tama. Nakakalungkot naman na kung sino ang sumusunod dito ang siya na ngayong pinarurusahan. Ano na ngayon ang hustiya kung ang mismong nararapat na maging modelo sa pagsunod dito ay lalabag at babaligtarin ang sistema? At mas lalong mahirap sagutin ay paano kung ang mga gumawa ng batas ay hindi naman pala kwalipikadong gumawa ng mga ito? Sa madaling sabi, kung ano lang ang maisip, iyon na ang batas na dapat sundin. Kung ayaw na ang ginawang batas basta burahin at kalimutan na lamang at sundin ang bagong naisip. Parang awa niyo na, pakihanap kung nasaan ang hustisya rito!\n\nTinuro kasi sa Kristiyanismo na dapat ay matutong magpatawad at hayaan ang Poong Maykapal na Siyang magbigay hustisya sa mga nabiktima at parusahan ang mga masasama at nagkasala. Ngunit likas sa tao na hanapin ang kanyang karapatan lalo na pag ito\'y niyuyurakan. Gusto ko talagang buong lakas na sugpuin sa sariling lakas ang mga akala mo kung sinong magagaling ngunit hindi naman patas sa pagbigay hukom sa mga tao. Pilit pa ring inilalagay ang sariling interes kaysa sa interes ng nakararami ang pinaiiral. Ganitong-ganito ang pinag-uugatan ng korupsyon sa ating bayan. Kasakiman. Kaswapangan. Walang sawang pagkamal para sa sariling benepisyo.\n\nImbis na tinutulungan at sinusuportahan ang mga nagsisimula at nais umunlad, sisirain at hihilahin pabagsak ang mga ito. Anong klaseng tao ang hindi wala ni pakialam o kagustuhang umasenso ang kapwa nila? Anong klaseng tao ang nais lamang na kagustuhan lamang niya ang manaig at makuha ang nais niya samantalang naghihikahos ang sana\'y kasamang nagtagumpay na rin? Nasaan na ang hustiya? Pati ito\'y ninakaw na nila.\n\nNgunit matapos ang ilang saglit na halos maiangat ko na ang impiyerno, pumasok sa aking isipan na hindi pa rin ito ang solusyon. Nakalulungkot man ang sinapit ngunit hindi pa naman nagtatapos ang daigdig sa iisang pangyari. Kahit tuloy-tuloy pa man ang pagsabog ng hindi pagkakapantay-pantay ay naroon pa rin ang panahon kung saan ang mga nasa ilalim ay tataas din. Hindi natatapos ang laban sa isang talo. May mga susunod pa at dapat itong paghandaan ng mas mabuti upang mas lalong lumakas. Darating din ang panahon at ito\'y aanib sa nilapastangan na sa kahit anong lakas ng kalaba\'y wala itong magagawa kundi ang sumuko. Matapos ang saglit na iyon ay bumalik pa rin ako sa riyalidad na isa pa rin akong Kristiyano.\n\nMas mabuting pagmukaing tanga kahit ika\'y nasa katwiran kaysa isang mapagpanggap na nagdudunong-dungan ngunit isa lang palang matandang mangmang.

(76,	1,	'2010-11-20 15:27:31',	'2010-11-20 15:27:31',	'\n				I participated and led the discussion of Chapters 10-12 of the Work is Yours by Br. Luke Salm in the faci applicant training for FORMDEV. This book that I\'m referring to is a biography of St. John Baptist De La Salle, the universal patron saint of the teachers. Of course, since I am part of FORMDEV, I need to know the life of our founder and share it to other students. The book is very comprehensive and detailed on some key events in St. La Salle\'s life from his ancestors to his childhood and to his fulfillment of mission (and death eventually). It showed different key people that played a role in St. La Salle\'s life may it be positive or negative.\n\nAnyway, I won\'t further give my feedback regarding the contents of the book since this is not a book review although I can say that the book is a very good documentation of one\'s biography. I would like to focus more on its contents- the wonderful and extraordinary life of St. La Salle. When you start reading \"The Work is Yours\" you will see that the ancestors of St. La Salle were rich and even his immediate family (from both mother and father side). That\'s why it is very inspiring to think of St. La Salle as a person who gave up a \"good\" life (meaning, giving up all of his wealth and become literally poor) just for the sake of building schools for the poor and educating them as well.\n\nAside from that, I would like to stress three points of realization. First, the most important of all, St. La Salle was able to contribute a lot in the field of education (teaching, management and the like). When you study his life, he opened schools for those who cannot afford going to school. He therefore managed classroom size lectures and started training teachers- not just teachers but Christan brothers as well. They not only teach in classrooms but they are also involved in community involvement (like visiting the sick and in prison to name some) and spiritual life. He also revised the subjects to be taught and focused not only in the arts but also in sciences. This made a significant change in the education in France and to the rest of the world as well. But this change also brought criticisms from the church and different sectors as well. This leads to my second realization- good works are obstructed by people who should be supporting it.\n\nSome signifcant people in the church like archbishops and priests, didn\'t take the mission of St. La Salle helpful and important. The main \"villain\" in St. La Salle\'s life was Fr. De La Chetardie who backed down in his plans. Furthermore, since the Lasallian schools were starting to grow, other educational institutions got envious with the former\'s growth. They filed cases against De La Salle. While some succeeded, it didn\'t stop St. La Salle from building more schools in different places. But the most challenging experience that he faced was when he was abandoned by some of the Brothers. He almost gave up but still went back after sometime in becoming the leader of the Christian Brothers.\n\nThe last point I would like to say is that St. La Salle\'s good works were blessed by God and miracles happened to support it. For example, there were rich people in different instances who funded the necessary things that the Brothers need. When there\'s famine, although all of the people suffered, they were able to bounce back easily and miraculously (food came suddenly and enough for them). Also, when some people try to contradict or disagree to the good plans of St. La Salle, other forces drove these contradictions away. And at one point, when St. La Salle was pressured by a particular individual, that person suddenly died and the pressure went away. Some of mentioned events may be considered coincidental but I\'d rather call it miracle for the greater good.\n\nI think and believe that St. La Salle deserves the title of patron saint of the teachers. Although the irony is, the Lasallian schools in the country are mostly for the rich and capable. The school has started its mission to reach out to the poor but deserving by giving out scholarships. But comparing it with the Lasallian schools in St. La Salle\'s time, it was far from how schools are established in the country. Well it can be explained because of the difference in time and state of the country. But it will still go down to having responsibility in allowing education to reach poor people. That means hopefully, giving quality education to all. St. La Salle\'s life is really an inspiration to all.

( used with a singular or plural verb <img src=\"http://sp.dictionary.com/dictstatic/dictionary/graphics/luna/thinsp.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" />) a system of moral principles-<a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/\">http://dictionary.reference.com/</a>\n\nIt is very interesting to tackle ethical issues concerning a crucial entity in the society- the media. When we talk about journalism (although I\'m not a BA Journalism student), it is always connected to democracy and freedom of expression/speech. But when we try to go deeper in analyzing the journalism in the Philippines, a lot of observations can be cited. These observations can be summarized in the book called <a href=\"http://www.pcij.org/bookshop/loremar.html\">\"From Loren To Marimar (The Philippine Media in the 1990\'s).\" </a>I finished reading this book and I found out why journalism in the country is very free. Well I\'m not saying that it shouldn\'t be free. What I\'m saying is that the journalism that is found in the country is very different from what it should be based on what\'s written in books and those taught in workshops/seminars. Totally free means, some of the essential traits that a journalist should have are sometimes neglected and instead doing the other way around. In the end, it goes to the journalist\'s freedom as well.\n\nI have attended several journalism workshops/seminars (because I was part of the university school paper) and a news is defined as something current that has an interesting story occurring in a specific place for a relevant audience. But unfortunately, TV networks have interpreted it in a one-sided manner. What these giant networks banner in their news are tabloid news- a 2-year old child stabbed by her mother, an 8-year old girl raped by her 80-year old grandpa etc. Although there are highlights on national events as well, there are still more important issues that could have been focused more. And it\'s funny because even Kris Aquino\'s parting ways with James Yap is always part of the news. The news shown are probably equalized with the definition of the word \"news\" mentioned. But is this the real essence of giving out the truth? Is it just giving out the truth no matter how boring it may be? Or considering other unimportant news but will bring higher ratings for the network?\n\nAnyway, so much for that. The mentioned issues have been attacked by other journalists and sectors as well. But I\'m still pointing out the implications of it and how it affects journalism ethics. But there is a new ethical dilemma that needs to be pointed out. The striking point now here is another ethical issue that ABS-CBN did. This is putting Noli De Castro and Korina Sanchez back as news anchors in TV Patrol together with Ted Failon (see news article about it <a href=\"http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=628722&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=70\">here</a>). At first you have to congratulate ABS-CBN for having successful turn-to-be-politician journalists. Probably, the network has helped these journalists in giving fame in order to win a political post. But after that, why is it that the network puts back politicians into a very sensitive position. According to <a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/community-journalism-in-national/community-journalism-101-what-is-a-conflict-of-interest\">Jonathan Donley</a>, and I quote, \"For a journalist, a conflict of interest occurs when he has a connection to the story subject or issue that might influence how he writes the story, or might cause people to distrust the writer or the news organization.\" Choosing the people who will make and deliver the news is very crucial in developing credibility with the audience. Putting a politician in the post of a journalist will make the news different. And that\'s true. Noli De Castro might be \"Kabayan\" whose goal is to help and seek out to people (that\'s why he also ran for a political position) but what about his controversy in the 2004 Presidential elections? True or not that he\'s involved directly, he is still involved in essence. What if there\'s a news about the latest updates/investigations in the \"Hello Garci\" scandal and it showed that the votes for the vice president were also tampered with evidence. Can he deliver the news himself when TV Patrol is aired? How about Korina Sanchez? Will she be able to deliver a news stating that VP Binay says insulting words to Mar Roxas and calling the latter a sour grape? The news organization through the people in it can influence the outcome of a news in a way they want it. So it is possible that some news that are conflicting maybe removed. And if that happens, where is the truth now?\n\nTed Failon was even a former congressman sometime in 2001. Can he deliver an objective news about his opponent when he ran for congress? Maybe yes. But will it be treated with credibility? It\'s questionable. The motive why people like them want to go back to becoming journalists maybe good and there\'s no question about that. But they made choices already that dictate who they are right now and they need to face its consequences. What they are doing is a conflict of interest. Maki Pulido and Alex Tinsay (if I remember them correctly) were both reporters from GMA and decided to run for a position. In one interview, Alex Tinsay said that in his journalism career, he saw the problems of the country and he wanted to help solving it. So he ran but lose. It\'s his choice and he took it. But there\'s no conflict of interest on his part and on the part of GMA.\n\nIn the end, I\'m not trying to discredit ABS-CBN and show favor to GMA. It\'s not about that. Although both networks clash for ratings, they still deliver important news. The point here is that, you have to be ethical especially in this field. I remember when I was student journalist, I didn\'t join any political party even as a member. That\'s how I value journalism very much. If ABS-CBN values journalism as well, they should consider choosing non-partisan but not apathetic journalists. There are still a lot of good men and women out there. They should not just consider choosing some famous people to bring their ratings high. Lastly, I realized that there\'s no such thing as an objective news. Some or even many would disagree about this. In my experience, you may try to be objective but you write on your perspective. You are objective in your perspective. So if that\'s an assumption, then it can be concluded that it\'s easy to make a news objectively in a perspective of a conflicting person to protect his/her interest.\n\nExcerpts from the <a href=\"http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/topstories/topstories/view/20060623-6286/The_Journalist%92s_Code_of_Ethics\">Journalist\'s Code of Ethics</a>:\n<blockquote>V.

This is a separate implementation from the color coding scheme that is used for private vehicles. These mentioned implementations are both helpful in a way although it is not felt as heavy as it is should be. The government agency like the MMDA is finding a way to solve the traffic issue. But we have to take note of the reality with regard to the roads constructed in the country. Admittedly and unfortunately, the roads are poorly made. The urban planning for the metro was not carefully considered because as you can observe, the roads go narrow suddenly then goes back to normal and there are also unusual small passages that are made that can result to accidents because of sudden concrete barriers. I have experienced that when driving in Edsa-Buendia, the road going to Magallanes is merged suddenly to the bottom of the flyover from Kalayaan. If you\'re not careful and turned left, a car coming from the flyover (whose speed might be fast because it\'s going down) might collide with your car and accident may occur. In Edsa-Cubao area, when you\'re driving towards Aurora Blvd underpass, you have to carefully avoid the concrete barrier for a small passage way for light vehicles. Take note, this passage way doesn\'t have a curve to follow but you just have to make a sharp right. So if you\'re not aware of it, it\'s either you hit the concrete barrier or get inside the passage going to the other side of Edsa. In the Commonwealth area, the roads are wider like say 5-6 lanes, but there are overpasses constructed on the 4th lane. It\'s like they\'re making a car arcade game where you need to avoid the obstructions or it\'s game over.</span></div>\n<span style=\"font-size:small;\">Well, with some mentioned irregularities in road planning, you cannot put all the blame to MMDA or DPWH. The given length and size of the roads remain constant but the population of both people and vehicles increase. The people dictate how many private and public transporation are to be dispersed at the roads and in essence dictate how heavy the traffic is. What the government is trying to do now is to maxime the roads available although the main drawback is that it is prone to accidents.\n\nAside from the fact there are problems with the unproportional length of the roads and the volume of vehicles, both the traffic/law enforcers and constituents sometimes abuse their roles. The abuse of rights and power add up to the traffic.\n\nSo what\'s the solution?\n\n<a href=\"http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/metro/view/20101112-302847/Number-coding-scheme-to-cover-buses-starting-Nov-15\">The current proposal of the MMDA to implement a number coding scheme for buses is helpful but lacking</a>. My suggestion is to to have not only a number coding scheme but and odd-even number scheme. This means that for a day only odd number buses are allowed to be in Edsa. For the next day, it\'s for the even numbers. If the odd-even scheme is enforced to buses then everyday 50% of the buses traveling in Edsa are prohibited. The bus operators complain this saying that it is not an answer because the buses are not the only ones that comprise the traffic in Edsa. That\'s true. But the main reason why the bus operators complain doesn\'t concern about the traffic. They\'re complaining because their income is at stake. The legal counsel in behalf of the bus operators suddenly burse out her arguments concerning the abuse of power of the enforcers that make the traffic worse. Maybe there are abusers but that\'s not the main concern but the profit. What these bus operators forgot to contemplate about are the advantages of the said number coding scheme. Let\'s say that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epifanio_de_los_Santos_Avenue\">Edsa is around 20 kms long</a>. If without the number coding scheme, the maximum speed of a vehicle during peak hours is 20kms/hr then 1 bus trip will go around approximately 1 hour or more. When the number coding is implemented, a bus can go as fast as 50kms/hr or more. This means that reaching from the start of Edsa to the other end will be cut to approximately 30 mins. Although what I\'m stating is an ideal case, still the time for a trip will be cut by half as well. Therefore if in a day there are 20 trips per bus in average then it will be doubled to 40 when the number-coding scheme is implemented. In addition, you won\'t be paying for the labor, gas and maintenance of those 50% that are not used. So if the bus riders/commuters argue regarding the scheme that there will be less buses, then think again. The bus ride becomes faster and more efficient therefore it can cater passengers of the same volume. This is just common sense.\n\n</span>\n\nAs what I\'ve said in the previous paragraph, the solution by MMDA is helpful but lacking. Why is that so? When you watch the morning and evening news, Edsa is still crowded ang there is still heavy traffic. The reason why there is still traffic is that the only lanes that are cut off by the vehicles are those found on the yellow lane. What about on the private vehicles lane? It\'s still the same. That\'s why I agree with the argument of the bus operators that they are not the only ones that cause traffic. There are also private vehicles, cabs, jeepneys, FX\'s and trucks.\n\nThe solution I suggest is straight to point but needs sacrifices, understanding and discipline. The private lane is also heavy during peak times. Therefore if we apply an odd-even scheme for the buses then we can say that an odd-even coding scheme should also be implemented for the private vehicles. If this is the case then it can be assured that only 50% of the total number of vehicles can pass through Edsa. If we want to see change then we should really adapt in this kind of scheme. A half change might not be experienced as a good idea like that of the Edsa buses but applying it to all will change everything.\n\nNow, there will be a lot of complains regarding this suggestion both from the commuters and private individuals who have their cars. But I have to ask, what then is a good long term solution for this problem? Can you, destroy those infrastructures that obstruct in widening the roads? Or can the government build a skyway at Edsa so as to double the area of the road? The only way to resolve traffic is to lessen the cars using the road. And that\'s one good solution. If that\'s the case, someone will ask where will the other 50% of the private vehicle users go? (plus I guess some of the 50% passengers of the buses affected in the number coding scheme) Here are my suggestions:\n\n1. Provide alternative roads and window hours for use of the major roads.\n\nEdsa is not the only road that can bring motorists to their destinations. The MMDA can permit the use of other alternative roads that these motorists can use. So for example, the number coding scheme is implemented in the major roads but not in the secondary roads. One good example of this is the Friendship Routes found in Las Pinas.\n\nAlso, window hours can be used which I think is also implemented now by the MMDA although it\'s not felt very much because of some abusive enforcers that don\'t honor it.\n\n2. Car pooling\n\nThis idea is already used by some people both in the academe and industry. This will not only help in saving money but also gasoline, time and environment as well. You don\'t actually need to allow anybody to ride but only those people you know like your neighbor or friends. Just tell them your house rules in the car (i.e. not to eat or drink and to close the door smoothly etc.). Just pay the driver for bringing you to your office or near office.\n\n3. Faster arrival of trains\n\nIt is not practical to suggest the government to create new train stations. This may take a while. But what is notable in the train stations in the Philippine is that it is found in major areas where people need to go to. My suggestion here and I think other poiliticians have already considered is to have more rotation of trains. This means that if it take 10 minutes for me to wait for a train then it should be lessend to 5 minutes. I have experienced waiting for more than 10 minutes (both in LRT and MRT) even during peak times. If the problem why they can\'t have faster rotation of trains is money, then I think they should increase the train fare already. Increasing the fare by 5 to 10 pesos is still reasonable I think if it will give an efficient, productive and comfortable train for the people.\n\n4. Big trucks should not be allowed to travel in the metro during day time.\n\nThis is very important because trucks are big but the roads are small. Therefore one truck can be equivalent to 3-5 small vehicles. Trucks are slow and big obstruction. So in order to minimize this, these vehicles should be banned not only in Edsa but in the whole of the metro (for a simple reason that other roads are even smaller than Edsa and thus, bigger trucks cannot be accommodated properly). Like for example when I\'m going to school, it\'s like one truck is equal to one green light just to pass Vito Cruz street. Instead of two lanes can be accommodated, only one lane is open because of the big and long truck. So if this is the case,  these trucks should be banned during day time and be allowed during the whole of the night time. It\'s like giving them a set of their own worlds.\n\n5. Sacrifice, discipline and understanding\n\nI know a lot of people will complain about my suggestion because it\'s hard for them to follow this. Imagine this scheme is implemented and the traffic is no longer heavy. Of course you like it. But in order to attain it, a change must be made not only for the bus sector. We should all take part and be responsible. If you really want to bring your car with you then you have to leave your house very early and leave your office late. It\'s still up to us if we want to attain a change for the better. If not, then you probably have to suggest another idea or we can just stay in this traffic problem forever. Lastly, according to the show \"The Explainer\" by Manolo Quezon in the episode of the \"Science of Traffic,\" an average of 10 years is wasted on one\'s life because of traffic in the metro. That\'s why for me, I\'d rather adjust myself in order to have a change rather than spent 10 years of my life in traffic.

That school was one of the famous and largest school (with a lot of satellite campuses) in town or in Cavite as well during my time. The reason why it was named ICA was the parish in the town proper is called Immaculate Conception (La Imaculada Concepcion) and of course during its feast day, the whole town celebrates and it was very festive.\n\nI noticed today when I was in Novaliches that  my cousin has a class even if it\'s <a href=\"http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07674d.htm\">Immaculate Conception</a>. Usually, Catholic schools declare a no class on December 8 if it falls on a class day. My cousin\'s school is<a href=\"http://sbsn.edu.ph/home.html\"> St. Benedict</a>, a Catholic School. My alma mater, <a href=\"http://www.dlsu.edu.ph\">DLSU</a> also has class today, same with my little brother in <a href=\"http://www.donboscomakati.edu.ph/\">Don Bosco Makati</a>. These schools I mentioned are all Catholic schools.\n\nAt first I thought that it\'s not good to have classes on December 8 because students won\'t be able to go to mass.  But later on I learned that the schools I mentioned have celebrated masses for their students. I realized that it\'s better to have class  rather than declaring a no class day because a student might not be able to go to mass (just stay home or go elsewhere). Having a class means to give them no option but to go to school and have mass.\n\nImmaculate Conception is a Catholic <a href=\"http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05089a.htm\">dogma</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.beginningcatholic.com/catholic-holy-days-of-obligation.html\">holy day of obligation</a>. That\'s why I think it\'s important for Catholics and practising Catholics to reflect on this day. And I think it is very important. I went to mass a while ago. I learned a lot about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blessed_Virgin_Mary_(Roman_Catholic)\">Mama Mary</a>. When we pray Haily Mary, we say that she is full of grace. Since she is full of grace, there is no space for sins. Thus, we say that she is an Immaculate Conception. Following this belief, the priest in mass said that the devil is afraid of Mama Mary because she is full of grace. That\'s why one way of <a href=\"http://www.stmichael.pair.com/exorcismschurch.html\">exorcism</a> is to call Mama Mary when driving out Satan/demon. Also, to prevent evil from getting near you or your home, place a picture of Mama Mary and call on to her. Satan is afraid of her.\n\nAt the end of the day, we hopefully should have reflected on Mama Mary and the Lord. It\'s amazing how Mama Mary can help us in resisting our temptations and prevent sins just by calling her.

I realize now that I\'m 21 and I need to do something different starting next year in order to attain my goals independently.\n\nSo, I think it has to start with character. Here are some resolutions in my character:\n\n1. I\'ll be punctual. No more lates. Always early. May it be on work or any scheduled meetings. Or even in meeting deadlines.\n\n2. I\'ll be more patient. When it\'s traffic or something has to wait, I will wait without any bad thoughts.\n\n3. I\'ll be humble. No matter what I have atttained, I\'ll just stay quiet. I won\'t say anything that will make other people feel small even some people will make me feel one.\n\n4. I\'ll be organized. My stuff will be in orfer and so are my schedules. I\'ll follow what I plan. No more messy areas. No more lost things. All are organized.\n\n5. I\'ll be more loving. I have to show my love even in the tiniest way possible. One way is to give time to the ones I love.\n\n6. I\'ll be persistent and zealous in work. That\'s what I learned in the FORMDEV reco.\n\nAnd for my goals...\n\n1. Have at least 8-hour rest for the day.\n\n2. Healthy foods only and less calories.\n\n3. Jogging and sit ups every day.\n\n4. Save money.\n\n5. Get certifications.\n\n6. Apply for graduate degree.\n\n7. Do faith duties and hear mass.\n\n8. Find a local community for service and spiritual growth.\n\n9. Visit relatives most especially grandparents as frequent as possible.\n\nThat\'s it. I hope this entry will remind me of what I should do and what I should become for 2011.\n\nThank you Lord for everything!!

(96,	1,	'2011-01-05 05:20:18',	'2011-01-05 05:20:18',	'\n				\"I vote for the vacation of the verdict with conviction there being a lingering doubt.\" Associate Justice Jose Catral Mendoza\n\nAfter reading the SC\'s decision regarding the Vizconde Massacre, it hardened my belief that although I wasn\'t there to witness the crime but based on the evidences presented, Hubert Webb et al are innocent.\n\nIf the Parañaque RTC and the Court of Appeals have denied more than 100+ evidences presented by the defense panel then the prosecutors should have a credible and authentic witness/witnesses. And I agree to the SC decision that <a href=\"http://www.newsbreak.ph/2010/12/14/the-jessica-alfaro-i-knew/\">Jessica Alfaro</a> is nothing but a liar. Here are some strong reasons:\n\n1. Why did it take Alfaro four years to come up and testify for the Vizconde case?\n\n2. Why did she have 2 sets of affidavits that are very, very<a href=\"http://archives.manilatimes.net/others/special/2005/jan/17/20050117spe1.html\"> inconsistent and contrasting</a>?\n\n3. Based on her story, why would she and her alleged boyfriend Peter Estrada (who was also one of the suspects) go and join with mere strangers (who are Webb et al) to the Vizconde residence after knowing that Hubert Webb and others would gang rape Carmela? And why would she even approach Carmela whom she just allegedly met twice before the crime in her residence if she knew Web et al would gang rape her? Were they close?\n\n4. Neither once in the recollection nor logbook of the subdivision guard by the name of Norman White he saw Alfaro walking and riding her vehicle several times in and out of the subdivision contrary to what she said.\n\n5. It is very weird that while the gang rape was happening, some \"members\" stayed outside the Vizconde house exposing themselves to the neighborhood.\n\n6. It is illogical to say that on the way out after the crime was committed, Hubert Webb would throw a stone to the Vizconde house for no reason at all (just to satisfy the fact that there were broken glasses in the house). They were escaping. So why make a noise? Alfaro cannot established trespassing since she already said that Carmela and Hubert were lovers.\n\n7. It is also illogical to say that during the crime was committed, her boyfriend (Estrada) opened the kitchen drawers and randomly asked her to find keys of cars and doors just to satisfy the fact that the house was messy and some valuable items were missing.\n\n8. The statement of the maid Mila Gaviola where she said that blood stains were found in the shirt of Webb contradicts with how Alfaro described how Webb carefully did the crime and leaving the scene clean. Hence, if Webb has blood stains in his shirt, he must have put it elsewhere. (but that\'s a different story)\n\n9. If Alfaro really pushed her allegations that Carmela was in a relationship with Hubert and that the girl was unfaithful with him by allowing another lover to be with her, then why was there no (not even one) friend or relative of the Vizconde or Webb testify to it as true? And if it were true, media must have spotlighted Hubert since he is a son of a star/politician. Thus, if Alfaro\'s statements were really true, then where\'s the other lover after the crime happened? Not one individual claimed to be Carmela\'s lover since 1991 until now. Finally, Alfaro\'s statement contradicts to the statement of Lauro Vizconde (father of Carmela) who said that her daughter turned down a suitor who\'s a politician\'s son.\n\n10. When Alfaro was presented to a suspect of the Vizconde case named Michael Rodriguez, a drug dependent from Bicutan Rehab, she slapped him and said \"How can I forget you? We just met in the disco a month ago....\" And it turned out to be a different person and the real suspect she was referring to was Miguel Rodriguez.\n\n11. And finally, Alfaro affirmed the statement of Atty. Artemio Sacaguing , then NBI Head for Kidnapping group, that she was supposed to bring the real witness (a man) who could shed light in the Vizconde Massacre. But she didn\'t bring the witness and instead took the place of the witness (pumapel). She didn\'t refute to the statement of Sacaguing thereby making her a stool pigeon or an NBI asset. This goes to show that she really is not a witness at all. She just assumed to be one.\n\n(see the SC decision <a title=\"Web et al v. People\" href=\"http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2010/december2010/176389.htm\">here</a>)\n\nWith so much inconsistencies with the primary \"witness\", I couldn\'t believe that the lower court accepted this testimony and discrediting so much alibi and witnesses of the accused.  As what Justice Carpio Morales said in her <a href=\"http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2010/december2010/176389_carpio-morales.htm\">concurring opinion</a>, \"A person may be credible where he is without previous conviction of a crime; who is not a police character and has no police record; who has not perjured in the past; whose affidavit or testimony is not incredible;  who has a good standing in the community; and who is  reputed to be trustworthy and reliable. Secondly, the person’s testimony must in itself be credible.\" With the facts given in the case, where now is the credibility of Jessica Alfaro?\n\nI\'ve read the <a href=\"http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2010/december2010/176389_villarama.htm\">dissenting opinion</a> of Justice Villarama primarily discrediting the evidences presented by the accused because they were falsified. But in his opinion, he didn\'t use Alfaro as a primary witness and instead used other witnesses to corner the accused. But I cannot be convinced. The airline ticket used by Webb cannot be falsified and so were the <a href=\"http://archives.manilatimes.net/others/special/2005/jan/18/20050118spe1.html\">records</a>. I really don\'t think it is possible to bribe the US Immigration and its Dept of State to testify in a written document that Webb was really in the US.  I can\'t believe that the lower court and even the CA believed that Webb could\'ve gotten back to the country and kill the Vizonde\'s and go back to the US so easily and falsify all those videos, pictures, documents and scripts to the people he met there. These documentary evidences were corroborating each other. It really pushes me to think that the Vizconde Massacre was really a trial by publicity.\n\nIt is now the credibility and integrity of the RTC that is questionable specifically the Judge herself, who is now a Court of Appeals Justice- <a href=\"http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=133416\">Amelita Tolentino</a>. To give a brief background, Justice Tolentino was a <a title=\"Tolentino Profile\" href=\"http://ca.judiciary.gov.ph/index.php?action=resume_of_justices&amp;x=35\">very intelligent student</a> in the school, garnering the title Valedictorian from grade school to law school. But as what I\'ve said in my previous<a href=\"http://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/2010/09/09/talk-shit-in-academe-etiquette/\"> blog</a>, grades don\'t dictate your character. Grades can be easily fabricated and medals can be bought at Recto.\n\nIn a <a href=\"http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2010/december2010/176389_sereno.htm\">separate concurring opinion</a> of Associate Justice Sereno (the lone Justice appointed by PNoy), she said, \"A review of the proceedings during preliminary investigation and trial showed that the prosecution did not fare much better, for it committed acts of prosecutorial misconduct that effectively deprived the accused of their constitutionally guaranteed right to due process.\"\n\nMore importantly, she emphasize there misconducts as: \"Some examples of prosecutorial misconduct would be the intimidation of defense witnesses, the obstruction of defense lawyers’ access to prosecution witnesses, the coercion of confession from the accused, the issuance of prejudicial comments about the accused, the mishandling and/or withholding of evidence, and the failure to preserve evidence.\"\n\nThe actions of then Judge Tolentino and her decisions showed bias in handling the case. She denied a the motion to inhibit after allegedly making a statement pertaining to the accused party as, “Failure of the accused to surrender following the issuance of the warrant of arrest is an indication of guilt.” She furthered her comment pertaining to the soon-to-be prisoners that they \"should not expect the comforts of home” afterwards she denied motion for inhibition filed by the defense party.\n\nThe injustice continued when Tolentino didn\'t allow the defense panel to cross examine Alfaro regarding the 1st affidavit she presented. She also sustained an objection regarding the defense panel\'s query regarding her brother\'s drug addiction to establish her motive and bias. Furthermore, she only accepted 10 out of 142 evidences submitted by the defense panel and later on, she denied petition for bail for the accused party. Finally, the trial court held that a DNA test would only lead to confusion of the issues.\n\nIn the end of her opinion, Justice Sereno concluded that, \"The various violations of the accused’s rights have resulted in his failure to secure a just trial. As such, the judgment of conviction cannot stand.\"\n\nIt is with prejudicial people who are expected to be open-minded that starts the light of a burning injustice. The Court, the institution which is expected to bring due process, failed to do so. Justice Sereno emphasized that the Court (of Justice Tolentino) has violated the rights of the accused based on the <a href=\"http://www.chanrobles.com/article3.htm\">Philippine Constitution (Art 3 Sec 14)</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.chanrobles.com/revisedrulesofcriminalprocedure.htm#RULE%20115\">Rules of Criminal Procedure (R 115 Sec 1 and R 116 Sec 10)</a>.\n\nIt is now therefore hard to answer whether justice can still be served.\n\nThis now goes to show that justice can be overpowered. Lawyers\' goal should not only win the case but giving what is due to the victim and penalizing the right suspects of the crime. Ethics is a very vital component here. If there should be somebody who should go to jail, it should be those false witnesses, unethical lawyers and judges and the sensationalist media people whose job is to ruin other people\'s lives in order to have something to eat.\n\nBoth Lauro and the accused are victims here. And the sadder part is that the murderers and rapists are laughing and still at large. Lives of Lauro\'s loved ones cannot be put back to life even the time spent by the innocent people in jail.\n\n\"In our criminal justice system, what is important is, not whether the court entertains doubts about the innocence of the accused since an open mind is willing to explore all possibilities, but whether it entertains a reasonable, lingering doubt as to his guilt.  For, it would be a serious mistake to send an innocent man to jail where such kind of doubt hangs on to one’s inner being, like a piece of meat lodged immovable between teeth.\n\nWill the Court send the accused to spend the rest of their lives in prison on the testimony of an NBI asset who proposed to her handlers that she take the role of the witness to the Vizconde massacre that she could not produce?\" - Excerpt from the SC decision.

Why is that so?\n\nThe severity of this attack is high because it indicates potential port scanning activities as well as bypassing basic packet filtering services and export restrictions through FTP. <a href=\"http://www.fortiguard.com/encyclopedia/vulnerability/ftp.bounce.attack.html\">(Fortiguard, 2006)</a>\n\nHow does FTP Bounce Attack work? In order for an FTP connection to occur, the client tries to connect to FTP through port 21. Another data connection is made between the two so that when the client wants to download something from the server, the latter can send the data back. To do this, through the \'PORT\' command, the client sends its IP address and an arbitrary port that is free to establish a successful connection\n\nNow the attack commences in the \'PORT\' command because the attacker can alter and send another IP address and port to the FTP server.\n\nWith the \'PORT\' command the attacker can do a port scan to another host in the Internet through a third party FTP server or even bypass filtering devices. <a href=\"http://giechelbit.duister.org/papers/security_ftp_bounce_sthuy.pdf\">(Telindus, 2003)</a>\n\nWhat can we do to prevent this attack from happening? If the root cause is the \'PORT\' command, then the solution is to limit the functionality of the \'PORT\' command to its purpose of sending its legitimate IP address and port number.\n\nA package called the <em>wu-ftpd </em>addresses the FTP bounce problem by ensuring that the \'PORT\' command won\'t be used to make connections to machines other than the original client.<a href=\"http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1997-27.html\">(CERT, 1997)</a>		',	'Attack of the Day: The FTP Bounce Attack',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'attack-of-the-day-the-ftp-bounce-attack',	'',	'',	'2011-01-15 05:21:36',	'2011-01-15 05:21:36',	'',	0,	'http://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=101',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

(112,	1,	'2011-02-16 06:05:17',	'2011-02-16 06:05:17',	'\n				On February 8, 2011, Former Sec. Angelo Reyes committed suicide infront of her mother\'s tomb. A shot in the chest that went straight to his heart took his life. At the same time, the foul-smelling dead fish of corruption in the AFP has been spreading like wild fire in the forest. Reyes was in question for allegedly receiving government money during his stay in his Defense Chief post or maybe before that as a military officer. He was a general and alumnus of PMA.\n\nWhen he died, sympathy flooded the country. Various officials say that he was a loss and that he gave a lot of contributions to the nation. Some also said that he was a victim of trial by publicity and he was framed up. Some critics have become sympathizers after lambasting Reyes as corrupt. Many said that what he did was a supreme sacrifice and honorable thing. And so he was laid to the Libingan ng mga Bayani (Heroes\' Cemetery).\n\nAfter the incident I asked: What makes somebody who committed suicide a hero? The heroes in the country were killed in war or executed because of martyrdom although I know that the definition of heroism doesn\'t only require those kinds of deaths. The government currently says that OFW\'s are the new breed of heroes. There are also heroes who saved lives of other people but still are able to save themselves from getting killed.\n\nThere\'s one character I know who is considered a hero after committing a suicide. It\'s the fictional character Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) from the movie Armageddon. He detonated the bomb, sacrificing his life, so that the asteriod will be cut into two and won\'t hit the earth. But it was just a movie with all the exactness of events that came up with all the people cheering after.\n\nI know that heroism comes with a price and I know that it takes a brave and courageous man to do become a hero. But heroes who dedicated their lives have an ultimate goal: to help and to serve others or for the greater good/glory. As I watched several close people, colleagues of Angelo Reyes who were giving speech about what he has done to the country, it can really be concluded that he has given his life for public service. He has dedicated himself in the military to the different offices opened by Presidential Decrees and different cabinet posts as well. There\'s really no doubt to such service to the public. But committing suicide, what a sad end to a good life. I really believe it is NEVER an honorable thing to do such act in the midst of a controversy involving your own name.\n\nIt\'s not a supreme sacrifice. How can it be a sacrifice when there\'s an anomaly and you refuse to face it? How can it be honorable when you know the <a href=\"http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110213-319959/Notes-from-a-last-conversation-with-Angelo-Reyes\">truth</a> and you can\'t say it? If Reyes were innocent, the hell what other people will think. It doesn\'t matter. You SAY you are innocent. The world posits to be prejudicial. When Hubert Webb was sentenced to life imprisonment, he didn\'t care what others say. He was firm in saying he\'s innocent until he was freed.\n\nMaybe Reyes has done good in the public. Maybe he has also done something bad as well. Well that\'s part of the definition of a human being - vulnerable, imperfect and prone to sins. But shutting up and not telling the truth, it\'s also the same as lying. Instead of making the issues clearer, the suicide raised more questions regarding AFP\'s corruption. I\'ve heard Teresita Ang-See who vouched for Reyes\' undoubted public service in Anti-Kidnapping and such. She said that it is impossible for Reyes to steal the money because of his \'good\' background. But you have to think that we are humans. We also commit mistakes. That\'s inevitable.\n\nWhen I heard that Reyes committed suicide, the only thing that came out of my head was- GUILTY. In one of TV Patrol\'s <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rRyPb2rQgA\">episodes</a>, Reyes cannot answer straight to Korina\'s questions regarding his involvement in the AFP corruption. His answers were short and vague like, \"Wala akong kinalaman dyan.\" (I have nothing to do with it.) He cannot further elaborate his findings and whereabouts during that time. In the same episode, Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago called him \"gago\" (stupid) for saying that he has nothing to do with the corruption issue. And I think, the blunt senator has a point. You are the Defense Chief (like a president) and the Comptroller (treasurer) has been stealing the money and keeping it for the higher officials and their wives. It\'s very impossible for the Chief to miss out findings of loss budget (say, hundred of millions of allocated budget) and just say \"Hindi ko alam ang mga \'yan.\" (I don\'t know about it.)   The senator was right in calling him stupid in that sense because Filipinos are not stupid when he said that.\n\nNow there are a lot of mourners. And there are also a lot who pity Reyes. It\'s part of the Filipino culture to sympathize and FORGET about the bigger picture. But again I say, Reyes\' death is not a supreme sacrifice.\n\nLast January, in my pay slip, P8,000 of my salary went to tax for the government. And I\'m going to pay my tax for the next years of my life. I\'m only one of the millions of Filipinos who work hard to earn money for a living and to support a family. Instead of having the whole money to have a little more for budgeting my daily life, it goes to the government which we expect to do its role in the society. That\'s why I think the Filipinos have the right to question the credibility of the government and to question where the hell do our taxes go.\n\nIt\'s not only an issue about money and life of a General. It\'s an issue of principle and transparency. The issue started from some sort of \"Mock Battle of Manila\" in the Ombudsman after a shitty plea bargaining agreement with a corrupt comptroller. We are getting to the bottom of the issue and it shouldn\'t stop. Penalize all those involved and remove the medals that they don\'t deserve. While the soldiers don\'t have the right gear and uniform for their war and old weapons and few bullets at hand, these Generals are enjoying the people\'s money by buying expensive houses and luxurious cars. Where in the world are the consciences and souls of these people? My friend Eddie said, these people are so greedy they stole money too much for their lifetime. How greedy. Now, is that something honorable? And now the truth is being covered up? Wake up!\n\nAs I was reflecting, I realized that Reyes\' suicide was very similar to what Adolf Hitler did when he was about to lose. Both of them were honorable in their respected positions although Reyes didn\'t intend to kill millions of Jews. But instead of facing the truth, they chickened out and killed themselves after committing mistakes they didn\'t want to correct.\n\nWhen I had my GREATWK, we studied a boring \"Great Work\" of Emile Durkheim, the book \"SUICIDE.\" We discussed the different kinds of suicide for 1/3 of the trimester (how boring!). Anyway, a lot of Reyes\' supporters think that what he did was ALTRUISTIC SUICIDE. This suicide happens when an individual is expected to kill himself on behalf of the society like soldier in a military service. But I beg to differ. I\'d rather consider it FATALISTIC SUICIDE. This suicide happens when a person prefers to die than to live within his society like preferring to die rather to be in prison with constant abuse which prohibits him from pursuing his desires.\n\nI would want Sec. Angelo Reyes to rest in peace. Death of person makes people especially loved ones sad. But I think there are lot of barriers to be in peace. Here are some of my realizations:\n\n1. Angelo Reyes\' death will not make any change in the corrupt government. It\'s another one wasted life. He\'s a victim of corruption that ate him.\n\n2. What he did was a selfish move. He only thought of himself and forgot about God\'s love, his family, his friends and the whole Philippine nation waiting for the truth.\n\n3. His suicide might have been triggered by guilt, like what Judas did after betraying Jesus (like him betraying the country) although both of them have served their masters.\n\n4. Good educational background doesn\'t make you a morally upright person. Harvard diploma doesn\'t give it. Grades are just numbers. Values come from the person. It comes from within.\n\n5. Heroes don\'t kill themselves in the middle of a fight or hide from the truth.\n\n6. And lastly, as what I\'ve learned in TREDONE with Dr. Arnold Monera, suicide is a one way ticket to hell.

That\'s because a lot of condominiums sprout like plants and you might get confused or deceived by sales agents or misleading advertisements. Although I still prefer a house built on my own land, condos are practical way of living in the urban area especially for those working in the metro.\n\n<strong>Location</strong>\n\nThe first thing you have to consider when buying a condo is the location. Remember, you are buying a condo to have immediate access to essential and necessary places. Of course, you wouldn\'t want to travel for so long just to get to office when you have a condo. What then is the difference of having a house in a nearby province to a 100-km far condo from office?\n\nOther considerations for the location are:\n<ul>\n	<li>Crowd (Is the place surrounded by what kind of people?)</li>\n	<li>Environment (How polluted is this area?)</li>\n	<li>Disaster-proof (Traffic, flood, earthquake, tsunami, accident-prone area)</li>\n	<li>Access to important places (Police, hospital, fire station, school, grocery, church, utilities)</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Size</strong>\n\nObviously, condo units are smaller compared to houses and the prices are more expensive. That makes me think that having a condo is not worth its selling price. But after doing some pro\'s and con\'s, I found out that the price has its sense although some prices are way too far from fairness. Sizes of units range from studio type like 18 sq m to some 90 sq. m. to 100+ sq. m. The average size for singles is the studio type ranging from 18-25 sq. m. On the other hand, for couples and small families have an average of 30-50 sq. m. In comparison to homes, these sizes are relatively small for families or even singles. But with good unit design (i.e. right furniture and appliances that can be used to maximize the unit\'s space), having that small size will make a difference.\n\nSome would prefer to have a fully furnished unit than a bare unit since the furniture and appliances are designed to fit in the unit. However, the downside of this is that fully furnished units look alike and triple the price from the original. In addition, it may not be as durable as the ones that are popularly known and in case you don\'t like some of the furniture, you cannot refund/choose another.\n\n<strong>Building structure</strong>\n\nNot a few observers have mentioned that the name of the developer be the large criteria in selecting the right condo for you. Maybe. But maybe not as well.  I would rather not use the developer\'s name as an influential basis when buying your unit. I\'d rather go general - building structure. Although I admit there are already some developers who have brought fame because of the structures they built, not all of the structures made are equally made \"perfect.\" There are still lapses. One must consider the physical structure though not so much civil engineering jargon.\n\nStart first with the general building structure features then go to the developer\'s name and track record. Things to consider:\n<ul>\n	<li>Number of units per floor - This depends. Although for high/average rise condos, there are 20-30 units per floor.</li>\n	<li>Number of floors in the building - Having so many floors is not good not. More people means more issues. Average number of floors range from 20-40.</li>\n	<li>Number of elevators in the building - How long are you going to wait before you can go up to your unit and go down to the ground floor? Some condos that I have visited queue up so long and they even reach the streets already.  Typical condos I\'ve seen range between 4-8 elevators, some serving only the lower half floors and the rest the upper half floors.</li>\n	<li>Number of exit stairs - There should be fire exit stairs on strategic places of the condo building. If the elevator is situated at the middle, stairs should be placed at the left and right side of the building.</li>\n	<li>Unit height - The normal height of a condo unit is 2.5m. Having a height of 3m. is already a high ceiling.</li>\n</ul>		',	'Guide in buying condo Part 1',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'guide-in-buying-condo-part-1',	'',	'',	'2011-04-08 18:11:52',	'2011-04-08 18:11:52',	'',	0,	'http://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=118',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

This involves some discussion about the Internet, network devices, how it works and the like. We will also talk about some technical concepts for us to better understand the networking process (i.e. how a data is transmitted over the network).\n\n<strong>Introduction</strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\nIn today\'s world, the Internet plays a vital role in communication. Everything became easier because of the Internet. Distance is not a barrier anymore. Before the arrival of Internet, the popular mode of communication to far places requires time, like when sending a mail for example. Now, it\'s just a click away through e-mail. We can also talk to our friends real-time through Instant Messenger (IM). Now, do you know how data is transmitted to your friend when you chat?\n\nA normal flow of communication contains a sender, a receiver and a channel. This also applies to a network. But of course, aside from the humans, devices also play its role. When you chat for example, the data is translated into a series of numbers which we call <strong><em>binary </em></strong>numbers (1 &amp; 0) to be understood by the computer and to be able to send it to its proper channel. There is a process of converting these messages to binary numbers through layers and network protocols.\n\n<strong>Elements of a Network</strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\nAs mentioned, the communication process for computer networking remains the same. What we need to understand now are things that make up the communication for computer networking. There are four elements:\n\n1.                  Rules\n\nLike when sending a snail mail to a friend, there are procedures on how to successfully send it. This includes putting it in an envelope, writing the address both of the sender and receiver of the mail at the back of the envelope and putting stamps. This is same with networking where rules, which are technically termed as protocols, define how the data is sent.\n\n2.                  Message\n\nMessage is the actual data itself. It is the file that you have sent through email. It is the video you are waiting to view in You Tube. This is the message in the letter you sent. This is self-explanatory.\n\n3.                  Medium\n\nThe medium is the element that says in what way the message is sent. For example in networking, for a typical Local Area Network (LAN), standard workstations are connected through a cable (a straight cable to be exact) while other laptops/net books connect via Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity).\n\n4.                  Device\n\nOf course, the device is an essential element as well. Different devices have their own role. Computers are used by the end users and these are connected to a switch and data are transmitted by a router to another.\n\nThese elements comprise the network. We will take a look at each element and give more details to each one of them.\n\n<strong>Network Architecture</strong>\n\nIf you are tasked to create a network, what will your basis be? Will you just buy workstations and connect them in a switch? There are concepts you need to consider in order to build a good network. You need to design your network based on the following key factors:\n\n1.                  Fault Tolerance\n\nIn creating a network, you shouldn\'t think of an ideal scenario where everything is all right. You have to think of possible problems which your network might encounter. For example, you put all your workstations connected in one switch. You find it very easy to do, setup and configure. But what happens if the switch goes down? Then your network will go down as well. Fault tolerance refers to the capability of the network to withstand forms of interruptions of its service. So most cases, there are back up servers, generators and network planned topologies in order to cater this particular concern.\n\n2.                  Scalability\n\nSo you have created the fault tolerant network that is good for the users in it. But is your network ready for a dynamic environment? Have you considered that the network may grow and will require more space, bandwidth etc? Scalability refers to the capability of the network to adjust in changes in the components of the network, may it be the number of users or devices.\n\n3.                  Security\n\nWhen you design your network, considerations must be made in order to group workstations based on security importance. What is security in this context? Security refers to giving access that is only needed by a particular type of user. For example, company reference materials should only be available within the company\'s network. External users should not be able to access these files. These particular privileges of access should be determined in the network design. The example I gave is what we call Intranet, which means access only “inside” the local network. You have to consider which part of the network should be given Admin access, User access and Guest access.\n\n4.                  Quality of Service (QoS)\n\nThe demands for network bandwidth vary from the type of work that people have. Which is more likely to consume more network bandwidth, the cashier or the web developer? You need to give priority over the ones who need more. In the field like IT Security, Security Analysts like me need more bandwidth because we are all connected to the Internet and all our work relies on having good network connection access.\n\n<strong>Network Communication</strong>\n\nSo let\'s say that you try to send an e-mail through http://mail.yahoo.com. The first thing you do is to type the <strong><em>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</em></strong> of the website which is – http://mail.yahoo.com. The URL is equivalent to an <strong><em>Internet Protocol (IP) address</em></strong> which is represented by numbers. We have URL’s so that we don’t need to remember numerical forms of addresses. Instead, we just type it based on the name that we associate with it like “mail” and “yahoo.” A particular protocol which is the Domain Name System (DNS) resolves the URL to its corresponding IP address. So think of the IP address a Website ID and the URL as the Website name.\n\n<a href=\"http://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/trace.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-125\" title=\"trace\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/2011/04/trace.png?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\" /></a>\n\nThe image above shows how the personal workstation travels going to http://mail.yahoo.com with IP address – 203.84.219.114.\n\nI just showed you how data travels to the domain Yahoo. Anyway, when the website appears in a web browser like the Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox, the data from the Yahoo site goes to your network and displays it. So from data understandable by the user, it goes through different layers which translate this data understandable by machines that can travel through different media (such as cables, atmosphere etc). A reference model is used for protocol classification per layer. We call it the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. The OSI model has 7 layers which defined to sort of give us an understanding of how data is transmitted and retransmitted.\n\nSo going back to the Yahoo mail site, the user interface that we see in the web browser is in the Application Layer of the OSI model. This is the topmost layer of the OSI model. This is quite easy to understand since the Application Layer gives interface of the data to the user. For this example, the protocol used is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is a protocol used to be able to browse web pages. There are a lot of Application Layer protocols aside from HTTP.\n\nThe next layer is the Presentation Layer. Its main responsibility is to do compression/decompression, coding, conversion and encryption/decryption. For example, when you load an HTTP, when we try to save images, there’s a default “Save As” to type of image which the site dictated what it should be like .jpg, .gif etc. Same is true with video types and media files. Sometimes for proprietary sites they have their own extensions.\n\nAfter the data is compressed, converted and coded, it checks the status of the data and connection. Did the data go to the correct destination? Is the connection active or not? Is the device idle or has been receiving information?\n\nLet\'s now go to the next layer called the Transport Layer. This layer is responsible for determining the kind of services the client/server are running and directing this particular service to the right port. For example, when you visit the site http://mail.yahoo.com, you go to a particular IP address 203.84.219.114. This particular domain might be running different services. Like for example, if you open its site through HTTP, it actually connecting to Yahoo\'s domain through port 80. If you are trying to send an e-mail through Yahoo mail, a connection is made through port 25 which is Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).\n\nThere are two popular protocols under the Transport Layer- User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The former is connectionless while the other is connection-based. There are services that are considered very essential to have an established first to make that the communication of data is received successfully. The <strong><em>three way handshake</em></strong> is a process used by TCP to ensure that connection is established before transmitting data. For example, in SMTP, the sure way to send an e-mail is to established a connection between the client and the server. Otherwise, we are not sure whether the data is sent properly or not.\n\nBasically, we learned how services are connected through ports. But before we\'re able to send the data to the right service, we have to send the data to the right network. This what makes the IP address necessary. This next protocol is called the Network Protocol. An IP address can be private or public. A private IP is an address given by a router used for local network. These include IP families from 192.168.x.x, 172.x.x.x and 10.x.x.x. Any IP addresses under those mentioned families are considered to be private. Public IP\'s are numbers otherwise and doesn\'t exceed 255.255.255.255. There are other conditions though. But for simplicity sake, public IP\'s are those that host a site for a particular organization.\n\nEach <strong><em>Local Area Network (LAN) </em></strong>has a <strong><em>gateway.</em></strong> When a particular host tries to send a data to another IP, it first checks whether the said destination IP is found within the network. If it finds it, then it is send directly to it. However for most cases, the destination is outside the LAN. Now, a target IP that is not found on the LAN is directly sent to the default gateway. This gateway passes the data to other routes in order to find the right destination. The router has three processes: forward the packet to the next route, deliver the packet to the destination or drop the packet. There are mechanisms through routing protocols used on how to determine best paths for data routing.

Seclist says that the Ecatel network is the source of a rootkit callesd Zero Access, \"...purpose of this rootkit is to set up a stealthy, undetectable and un-removable platform to deliver malicious software to victim computers.\" [1] As of writing, the Elcatel Network is rated second, in the Top 10 Hosts Bad for the 1st quarter of 2011. [2]\n\nA malware site has only one goal: to do something bad to you like getting confidential/private information and doing something harmful to your computer. Considerably, many sites under the said network are considered harmful but of course, we cannot generalize that all of them are. But since it\'s coming from the same network, then we might consider it as suspicious.\n\nThe Ecatel Network is part of the Russian Business Network (RBN) which is known for cybercrime activities since 2007. News also say that Russian authorities don\'t give enough attention to the cybercrimes made.\n\nA lot of articles tell that this particular network is noted for spammers. Spamhaus event named it as \"The Most Notorious Spammers.\" Further, it listed 15 known sites which were classified as popular for Zeus Botnet Command &amp; Control Activity, Showshoe Spam Sources, Heavily Abused Redirect, Botnet Pharma Spammers and Cybercrime Hosting of Fake A/V Malware. [4] It also plants rootkits on infected machines which can monitor and control personal workstations illegally. Some sites under Ecatel also trick users of Fake Antivirus crimeware. These crimeware resulted to more than 250,000 computers became affected. [5]\n\nTo make our measurement of Ecatel Network\'s maliciousness quantitative, let\'s look at the numbers: [6]\n\n1 Zeus server\n\n3285 malicious URLs\n\n1076 badware instances\n\n846 spam bots\n\n16 spam IPs\n\nHere are also the IP addresses that are considered the \"dangerous\" as related to Ecatel Network: [7]\n\n62.41.26.0/24\n\n62.41.27.0/24\n\n89.248.160.0/21\n\n89.248.168.0/24\n\n89.248.169.0/24\n\n89.248.170.0/23\n\n89.248.172.0/23\n\n89.248.174.0/24\n\n89.248.175.0/24\n\n93.174.88.0/21\n\n94.102.48.0/20\n\n94.102.49.0/24\n\n94.102.62.0/24\n\nNow that we know some knowledge about Elcatel and how it can affect us then I suggest that we do best practices when doing transactions through the net. Of course, it\'s good to have an AV with updated set of signatures. I know that new malwares are emerging everyday but AV will also help somehow. We should also have our personal firewall installed because it will help in classifying rules. For example, there might be site redirection and might bring you to a malicious site. If the firewall has restricted that particular IP/URL to your network, then it can\'t enter. And try to avoid going to sites that you are not familar with. Chances are, it may be a malicious site. But when that comes and there\'s a pop-up that says that you need to run this kind of AV, you know that it is a Fake AV. So don\'t.\n\nFinally, as what I always say when there is an infected workstation, remove it from the network immediately and run an AV with updated set of signatures. But to be sure, it is a best recommendation to re-image the system to completely remove any malware.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Reverse Engineering the source of the ZeroAccess crimeware rootkit from http://seclists.org/pen-test/2010/Nov/33\n\n[2] Top 10 Bad Hosts - 2011 Q1 from http://www.hostexploit.com/\n\n[3] Shadowy Russian Firm Seen as Conduit for Cybercrime from http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/12/AR2007101202461.html\n\n[4] The Spamhaus Project Reports Ecatel.net Network Host The Most Notorious Spammers Cybe from http://www.scamfraudalert.com/identity_theft_phishing_spam_blackmails/13773-spamhaus_project_reports_ecatel_net_network_host_most_notorious_spammers_cybe.html\n\n[5] White Hat Hacker Cracks ZeroAccess Rootkit from http://www.informationweek.com/news/windows/security/228300156\n\n[6] AS29073 - ECATEL-AS from http://badhost.info/AS29073\n\n[7] Ecatel: Need more proof of their being crimeware? from http://hphosts.blogspot.com/2010/04/as29073-ecatel-need-more-proof-of-their.html		',	'Understanding Ecatel',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'understanding-ecatel',	'',	'',	'2011-04-30 13:48:35',	'2011-04-30 13:48:35',	'',	0,	'http://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=128',	0,	'post',	'',	0),
(132,	1,	'2011-05-16 04:47:09',	'2011-05-16 04:47:09',	'\n				by Justin David Pineda\n\nTourist guide Carlos Celdran\'s association to the church as “Damaso” and to himself as Jose Rizal, a hero for freedom is a fallacy. [20] First of all, priests today neither live extravagantly nor have control on the law. That\'s why their stating their stand. Second, we\'re no longer colonized and Celdran was not shot at Luneta after what he did. (with pun intended)\n\nBut seriously, a lot of people who are skeptics always tend to conclude that the stand of the church is very close minded and conservative. May it be written that these assumptions are true. However, that doesn\'t conclude that whatever they say has no merit or point because that\'s just one big hasty generalization. Further, we should treat religion as a concept and don\'t judge it based on the people; because people (even fictional character) like “Damaso” commit mistakes. But the concept of religion remains and it has something good in it. You don\'t judge a stand guilty by association to the church and just go to the other side and proclaim that it\'s okay to get excommunicated. It\'s just not logical.\n\n<strong>Objective of the RH Bill</strong>\n\nObviously, before we can make an opinion regarding the RH Bill, we should have read the whole bill first. I\'ll base my stand on the bill itself supporting it by factual data. So as a start, we must define what the Reproductive Health is. And as the bill defines: [1]\n\n(Sec. 4, c.) ...as the state of physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes. This implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life, that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so, provided that these are not against the law. This further implies that women and men are afforded equal status in matters related to sexual relations and reproduction.\n\nThe definition of reproductive health in the context of the bill relates to “satisfying and safe sex.” There is nothing wrong with that. But later on, we will use this definition in application to the bill\'s provisions.\n\nSo in summary (assuming you\'ve read the bill), the main points that the bill wanted to achieve are to educate the people regarding reproduction (i.e. sex and its factors) and to promote responsible parenthood to manage population and reduce poverty. [3]\n\n<strong>Fuzzy Logic</strong>\n\nIf the argument of the bill is when we reduce the population, we reduce the poverty then these pro-RH legislators believe that population is the cause of poverty. But is the population the real cause of poverty? Let\'s say that the population is reduced from 100 million to 50 million (hypothetical). Do you actually think that even reducing the population by half (well, I exaggerated it), poverty will be reduced in percentage (not on number of people of course)? I won\'t dwell on comparison and contrast between other countries that are populated and yet far with the country\'s economic status because it’s very relative and very debatable. But the bill’s premise does not necessarily follow this logic. I would like to stress out that <em>population </em>is not the cause of poverty. If you don\'t agree, tell me what kind logic will result to reducing population equals reducing poverty. If you say Singapore, then why are they paying the people to give birth to children and ask foreigners to live in their land?\n\n<strong>Practicability of Contraceptives</strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\nAs per the RH bill, it considers contraceptives as “essential medicines.” [1] \n\nSEC. 10. Contraceptives as Essential Medicines. – Hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, injectables and other allied reproductive health products and supplies shall be considered under the category of essential medicines and supplies which shall form part of the National Drug Formulary and the same shall be included in the regular purchase of essential medicines and supplies of all national and lord hospitals and other government health units.\n\nThese essential medicines will be available to every part of the country, which will be distributed by the baranggays to the people. As of writing, there\'s no amount yet stating how much should be allotted for these medicines. But if it\'s for the whole of the country, surely it will range from about hundred millions to billions of pesos. That amount of money is not just something that we can easily get.\n\nLet\'s now try to dig on some historical account on the effectiveness of contraceptives. During the \'90\'s, until the late 2000\'s, USAID has supported the Philippines by giving budget to contraceptives costing $3.1M US annually. [11] DoH on its part, has also been giving budget for family planning and responsible parenthood annually. As planned on 2010, Sec. Enrique Ona said that P931M is his budget for family health program where P400M of it will be used to buy contraceptive pills, condoms and injectables. [10]\n\nIf I may ask, there already have been efforts already by the government and other organizations about population control and responsible parenthood. But are there any positive changes on the growing population of the country? What I\'m saying is, there are already existing efforts and it\'s pointing out to saying that contraceptives are not the answer to population control and poverty reduction.\n\nHence, why is the government giving so much budget and attention to contraceptives and treating them as essential medicines when according to the World Health Organization (WHO) the top ten causes of death in the Philippines are: lower respiratory infections, Ischaemic heart disease, tuberculosis, hypertensive heart disease, perinatal conditions, cerebrovascular disease, violence, diarrhoeal diseases, diabetis mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. [8] There is not one disease that is related to the use of contraceptives. Why not instead of looking for ways to treat these diseases, the government is focusing on these things? That\'s just unfair. According to Atty. Jo Imbong of the CBCP, the primary cause of maternal death is pneumonia. [18] Were they able to put the cure for pneumonia an essential medicine for the mothers?\n\nRep. Liwayway Chato has a point in saying that the bill is not applicable at most cases for couples. She says that what if the couple wanted to have intercourse at that particular time, would the girl care to say stop and let\'s go to a baranggay and ask for a condom? [18]\n\n<strong>Legal Issue</strong>\n\nEric Manalang, President of the Pro-Life Philippines, says that the main source of the RH bill didn’t come from Philippine legislators. The RH bill was initiated by the US as a form of aggression to preserve resources for America. [20] Atty. Imbong points to the same thing. She further states that the country has accepted the idea of Reproductive Health as discussed in the international context which involves abortion. Although the bill doesn’t explicitly say abortion, it adapts the idea without even scrutinizing it properly. Thus, during international meetings about it, no Philippine delegation was present. [18]\n\nDuring an interview with Tomas Osias, executive director of the Commission on Population, he admitted that the bill might involve abortion. Later on he apologized for saying such, for he was pressured. Benjamin De Leon, professor at UP and the president for Forum for Family Planning &amp; Development Inc, says that abortion is just a definition of term. But if we’re to apply the definition, we are killing already. [19] Both the former and the latter are pro-RH and have been involved with meetings and fora about the bill.\n\nFor this matter, there may be some grey area whether or not abortion is present in the bill implicitly. That’s because both the church and the pro-RH have different definitions of start of life. But what we know is that abortion is killing. Abortion is bad.\n\nNot using the grey line of abortion, there is one law that overrules the RH bill. And this is Article 15 of the Philippine Constitution. Its excerpt: [17]\n\nSection 1. The State recognizes the Filipino family as the foundation of the nation. Accordingly, it shall strengthen its solidarity and actively promote its total development.\n\nSection 2. Marriage, as an inviolable social institution, is the foundation of the family and shall be protected by the State.\n\nThis concludes that the bill wanted to be passed is unconstitutional because of human life prevention.\n\n<strong>Medical Issue</strong>\n\nThe bill states that contraceptives are defined as essential medicines. [1] Aside from pregnancy prevention, it also helps in menstrual disorders like lack of blood, excessive blood, menstrual cramps etc. [12] But in the context of the bill, it seems like these other features are just “added features” because the main premise of the bill is for population control. That’s why I don’t see the point of calling it an essential medicine when your intention is not to get pregnant. Medicine is something you take in order to get well and remove sickness.\n\nManalang states that when you take a chemical or mechanical is not healthy. [19] Probably that’s right. But what are the effects of contraceptives? According to Medicine.NET, here are some of the side effects: dizziness, headache, lightheadedness, stomach upset, bloating, or nausea, severe depression, groin or calf pain, sudden severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, lumps in the breast, weakness or tingling in the arms or legs, yellowing of the eyes or skin. [13] Further research says that it increases carbohydrates in your body. [15] Another research states that contraceptives saturate the gallbladder bile with cholesterol. [14]    \n\nChato on her part says that the natural state of a woman is to get fertile. In the context of the Reproductive Health, it doesn’t promote reproduction healthy. The bill mainly states in favor for safe and satisfying sex. She further says it is unhealthy. [18]\n\nFor my part, you don’t connect maternal problems that are naturally occurring to the problem of population or poverty. It’s a very different case. When they promote the use of contraceptives, they don’t include its negative effects. Now tell me, is that healthy?\n\n<strong>Moral Issue</strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\nSince there is a grey line between the start of life then let us not use that as an argument. A good question to ask is: What is the implication of giving away contraceptives for free to individuals who are not even married and say, college students? What is the implication of giving the law to the hands of the youth to protect them from their parents who are stopping them to have sex and use contraceptives?\n\nRep. Janette Garin, pointed out that there are 12-15 year old girls whom she assisted to give birth and she said it was pitiful. She also mentioned cases of abortion because of unwanted pregnancies and experiments. [18] But I don’t agree that giving them contraceptives is the answer. On the other hand, I agree with Manalang that these things that Garin mentioned are effects. These already happened because of a cause. Let’s just put it this way. How can you promote responsible parenthood when you morally allow and uphold unmarried couples or individuals have casual sex? I hope we’re at the same page here.\n\nRep. Luz Ilagan, another pro-RH legislator was asked by Karen Davila if there is an age appropriation when for example a girl would like to have a pill or any kind of contraceptive. She answered that the bill is giving an informed choice. So, if the girl is educated and undergone their seminars then she is free to get what she wants as mandated of their bill [20]\n\n<strong>A gun pointed at one’s head</strong>\n\nWell, if you don’t believe that it’s God’s will not to follow the RH bill, I’ve given you other reasons why. I still have to go back to the main premise of this bill: What is the cause of poverty? Is it population? In my 21 years of existence in the country, I found that the country is rich full of resources. I found that we have the agriculture and also the brains. But why is it that we’re still in poverty? Again, I think it still boils to corruption and lack of opportunities. Is the problem with corruption and lack of opportunities resolvable? I think so. But not through the RH bill.\n\nYou don’t correct a mistake by another mistake. Meaning, Garin’s reasoning that in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy then you should use contraceptives is very incorrect. [18] You should teach them that to prevent unwanted pregnancy (which might lead to abortion, poverty and maternal disorder) is to teach them not to have casual sex and not to have sex and use contraceptives.\n\nCeldran accuses the church of being anti-poor because they protest against distribution of contraceptives for free which targeted the poor. He further says, “Why not rally in 7-11 or Mercury Drug or Forbes Park?” [20] Well, I say that they all have the right to protest not only the church but any taxpayer who works very hard. Why will the government use the people’s money to buy contraceptives to tolerate the libido when in fact what these people need is livelihood? Hence, the government is trying to institutionalize it, mandating its office to provide these services. Isn’t this something to think about?\n\nIf allowing unmarried couples and the youth to have access to contraceptives then again, this makes the bill promiscuous and unconstitutional as per Article 15 of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines. [17] In relation to this, Prof. De Leon and Rep. Garin say that Pulse Asia and SWS survey reveal that 9 out of 10 people wanted the bill to be passed. In reply, Manalang said that little noises like surveys are politically motivated. More importantly, he noted that surveys are incomparable to a constitution ratified by at least 76% of the Filipino people. [20]\n\nI agree with Rep. Chato about the importance of people- that people aren’t hindrance to development and are the nation’s investment. [18] The problem lies on opportunities. Once you’ve given opportunities and challenges to people then they will stop thinking about immoral stuff like casual sex. They will think with goals. At the end of the day, the population will reduce naturally.          \n\nReferences:\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Articles</span>\n\n[1] Full text of House Bill No. 5043 (Reproductive Health and Population Development Act of 2008) from <a href=\"http://jlp-law.com/blog/full-text-of-house-bill-no-5043-reproductive-health-and-population-development-act-of-2008/\"><em>http://jlp-law.com/blog/full-text-of-house-bill-no-5043-reproductive-health-and-population-development-act-of-2008/</em></a>\n\n[2] The RH Bill: A Legislation with Good-Sounding Objectives by Jen Yoro from <a href=\"http://jlp-law.com/blog/full-text-of-house-bill-no-5043-reproductive-health-and-population-development-act-of-2008/\"><em>http://jlp-law.com/blog/full-text-of-house-bill-no-5043-reproductive-health-and-population-development-act-of-2008/</em></a>\n\n[3] Reproductive health bill: Facts, fallacies by Edcel Lagman  from <a href=\"http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/talkofthetown/view/20080803-152296/Reproductive-health-bill-Facts-fallacies\"><em>http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/talkofthetown/view/20080803-152296/Reproductive-health-bill-Facts-fallacies</em></a>\n\n[4] Church, Palace agree condom not abortifacient from <a href=\"http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/03/30/11/church-palace-agree-condom-not-abortifacient\"><em>http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/03/30/11/church-palace-agree-condom-not-abortifacient</em></a>\n\n[5] 2010 World Population Data Sheet from <a href=\"http://www.prb.org/pdf10/10wpds_eng.pdf\"><em>http://www.prb.org/pdf10/10wpds_eng.pdf</em></a>\n\n[6] Ang panukalang batas na Reproductive Health and Population Development Bill from <a href=\"http://www.popcom.gov.ph/RH%20BILL/Layout%20of%20Q&amp;A%20on%20RH%20Bill%20(for%20inputs%20of%20partners).pdf\"><em>http://www.popcom.gov.ph/RH%20BILL/Layout%20of%20Q&amp;A%20on%20RH%20Bill%20(for%20inputs%20of%20partners).pdf</em></a>\n\n[7] POPCOM History from <a href=\"http://www.popcom.gov.ph/about_us/index.html\"><em>http://www.popcom.gov.ph/about_us/index.html</em></a>\n\n[8] Mortality Fact Sheet 2006 from <a href=\"http://www.who.int/whosis/mort/profiles/mort_wpro_phl_philippines.pdf\"><em>http://www.who.int/whosis/mort/profiles/mort_wpro_phl_philippines.pdf</em></a>\n\n[9] Doctors warn DOH on contraceptives from <a href=\"http://ph.news.yahoo.com/doctors-warn-doh-contraceptives.html\"><em>http://ph.news.yahoo.com/doctors-warn-doh-contraceptives.html</em></a>\n\n[10] DoH Sets P400 Million for Contraceptives by Hannah L.

Gayundin, marami tayong mga pagsubok na daraanan upang makamit ito. Hindi ba napakasarap sa pakiramdam ang matamo mo ang iyong pinaghirapan matapos ang matitinding pagsubok? Kahit gaano kaliit o kalaki ang iyong planong abutin, kapag natamasa mo ito, isang malaking ginhawa ang papasok sa ating katawan. Ngunit paano kung ika\'y naluklok na sa pangarap mong estado sa buhay? Dahil mas malayo na ang narating mo sa iba na maaaring nagsisimula pa lamang, iba na ang pamantayan mo sa buhay. Dito nagkakaroon ng problema. May katotohanan din ang sabi-sabi na kapag ika\'y nasa tuktok na, nakakalimutan mo ang nasa ilalim mo.\n\nPersonal kong nasaksihan ang indirektang sapilitang pang-aalipin ng mga nasa taas sa mga taong nasa ilalim nila. Sang-ayon naman ako na dapat may mas nakakataas sayo o may mga posisyon na pagpipilian base sa kaalaman at karanasan. Ngunit sukdulan akong hindi sang-ayon sa pang-aabuso ng mga nasa taas sa mga tao sa ibaba nila. Ganoon ba talaga kapag ika\'y mas makapangyarihan kaysa sa iba? Sadya bang hindi maiiwasan ang tukso nang kapangyarihan?\n\nNaniniwala ako na nilikha ang tao na pantay-pantay at may pare-parehas na karapatan at kalayaan. Hindi maaaring mas maraming karapatan ang isang taong mas mataas ang posisyon kaysa sa isang taong kinasasaklawan ng kanyang kapangyarihan. Sabi nga ni Marjorie Evasco, \"We\'re all the same. We all eat and we all shit.\" May kaakibat na responsibilidad ang lahat ng tao ano man ang estado nito sa buhay. Isa sa pinakaimportanteng responsibilidad ng bawat nilalang dito sa mundo ay ang respetuhin and kapwa lalong-lalo na ang kanilang pagkatao.\n\nKaya naman ganito na lamang ang aking pagkamuhi sa mga taong pilit na nang-iipit at nang-aalipusta nang kapwa sa pang-aabuso ng kanilang kapangyarihan at talikuran ang karapatan at dignidad ng kanilang kapwa kasama na rito ang kanilang mga tauhan. Tapos na ang giyera at pananakop ng iba\'t ibang mga banyaga. Ngunit gaya ng kwento ni George Orwell na hango sa Stalinism, mismong mga ka-uri na natin ang nagpapahirap sa atin. At totoo iyon. Tumingin ka lang sa iyong paligid at makikita mo na kung ano ang sinasabi ko.\n\nMarami sa atin ang pilit na kakapit sa patalim upang magtuloy-tuloy ang buhay sa mundong ito kahit ang naghihintay na kapalaran ay mapait at hindi patas. Hindi naman natin sila masisisi. Sa kabilang dako, mayroong mga tao na prinsipyo ang pinanghahawakan sa sarili. Isang bagay na hindi matutumbasan nang kahit anong salapi o suhol. Hindi naman ibig sabihin na ang mga taong kumakapit sa patalim ay walang prinsipyo. Ang prinsipyong tinutukoy sa isang ma-prinsipyong tao ay gagawin kung ano ang tama at iwawasto, hindi gagawin at hinding-hindi tutularan ang mali.\n\nDapat nating himukin ang bawat tao na kasapi sa ating komunidad o organisasyon na ipaglaban ang kanilang karapatan at dignidad. Kung sila\'y natatakot at pilit na kumakapit sa patalim, walang progreso at hustisyang magaganap. Ang pagkapit sa patalim ay isang gawain upang makapagatuloy sa buhay ngunit siya namang tuloy-tuloy sa pagsugat sa kanilang mga sarili. Hindi lubusang natatamasa nang mga taong ito ang tunay na ibig sabihin ng kalayaan. Dapat nating sugpuin ang walang awa at ganid sa kapangyarihan at patalsikin sa pwesto ang ganitong mga tao. Hindi sila karapat-dapat sa posisyon na kanilang kinabibilangan ngayon. Kahit man isang pangarap at bagay na inaasam-asam mula sila\'y bata lamang na mapabilang at makakuha ng isang mataas na posisyon, wala silang lugar para rito. Dapat sila\'y nasa kulungan upang pagbayaran ang kanilang pagmamalabis at pagpapahirap sa mga taong kanilang nasa ilalim.\n\nKapag tayo\'y magsasama-sama at pag-aalabin ang prinispyong maka-tao, sinisiguro ko na walang maaapi at walang sinuman ang susubok na manapak ng karapatan ng ibang tao. Wala nang matatakot pa na baka sila\'y lalong saktan kapag itananong at inilaban ang karapatan. Tandaan natin, kakaunti lamang ang nasa itaas. Marami ang sama-sama sa ilalim. Gaya nang pagpapatalsik sa isang pangulo matapos itong mawalan ng suporta, ganito rin ang mangyayari sa iba pang mga pinuno na hindi kayang gampanan ng maayos ang trabahong iniatang sa kanya.\n\nGaya ng aking nabanggit, marami ang nangangarap mapunta sa itaas. Marami ang gustong mapunta sa isang maginhawang pwesto. Pero mas mataas ang pwesto, mas marami ang responsibilidad. Ang amag sa tinapay ay nakakalason sa taong kakain nito. Ngunit sa isang mundo na maraming nagugutom, pilit nila itong kakainin. Pero hindi ba kung isang parte lamang ng tinapay ang may amag, maaari naman natin itong tanggalin at kainin ang tinapay pagkatapos?

(139,	1,	'2011-08-19 17:06:38',	'2011-08-19 17:06:38',	'\n				My dad told me that it\'s best to invest on real estate like a house or a condo unit because its value appreciates as time goes by. Yes, I agree. And because people like me who\'s not born rich, starts from the bottom going up the ladder. If that\'s the case then it means that the state of being rich is low when you start working and it goes up as time flies. This concludes that the hindrance for abundance is \'time.\' That\'s because everything takes time yet life is short.\n\nAnyway, another thing my dad told me was that investing in cars and technology (i.e. expensive cellphones/laptops) is bad because its value depreciates in a short span of time. As Moore\'s Law applies in essence, the value of a gadget is half after less than a year in parallel with a technology that is double the power of the current one. Also, the value of a car depreciates drastically while its maintenance is very expensive. So, it\'s still impractical to get one when you have a lot of other more important priorities that you support financially.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, my dad gave my a new Toyota Innova J series (Diesel). It\'s the cheapest among the Innova series but I would agree that the differences vary very slightly like accessories and such. But the important thing is the engine, which is good because it has the same engine as the Fortuner. It also has comfortable seats good for 8 people and a compartment at the back. So, the mission given to me is to survive a life with a car. My philosophy always says \"practicality and simplicity.\" At first I don\'t really like having a car because it\'s expensive etc. But now that I have one already, then it\'s time to use it in the most practical and simplest way possible.\n\nI did a lot of changes in my car style when I handled the Innova. Vast changes occurred and that\'s because it\'s my responsibility now:\n\nI don\'t rush when I drive. Never anymore. When there\'s a jeepney trying to cut my way even if the driver counter flowed, I\'d still give him the space. That\'s because I know it\'s a pain in the ass if the jeep bumps on me and I would to pay for the repairs.\n\nI always try my best to drive in the coolest way possible. My average speed in the highway is just 60kph. I don\'t race with other cars even if they\'re provoking me to. I don\'t speed up when it\'s Yellow in the traffic light. Instead, I start slowing down and hit the brakes even if it\'s not turning fully stop yet.\n\nI don\'t try to play with vehicles who are very careless. I sound the horn very loud so they would know that somebody is beside or near them even if they get annoyed.\n\nI don\'t rush on bumpy and moon-styled roads. I drive slowly to avoid all those holes and other road texture problems. I don\'t mind anymore even if the car behind me is rushing (unless it\'s an ambulance) and keeps on sounding the horn so I would rush.\n\nI clean the car very often both external and internal. I do the cleaning or sometimes the car wash boys do it. But I have my own stuff as well. I don\'t want the car look dirty.\n\nI want the car to be safe. My dad started it with an centralized lock with an alarm. I do have my own security by putting lock on the steering and the brake pedal. I also invest in putting the car in a safe parking lot with a roof even it costs quite expensive. And everywhere I go, before I bring the car to the destination, I make sure that there\'s a secured place for the car to stay.\n\nAnd I learn how to look for the cheapest gasoline stations in the area to maximize my money. I also learn how to look, study and measure all the routes when going to office, Cavite etc. to be able to maximize the gas. It makes me learn a lot actually. I get exposed to shortcuts and alternative roads.\n\nIn the end, even if it\'s just a month old, I feel like I\'m already raising a child. Taking care of a car is so expensive. But it makes you more responsible and mature. At the same time, you get the comfort that some don\'t experience.\n\n&nbsp;		',	'Doing the Math',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'doing-the-math',	'',	'',	'2011-08-19 17:06:38',	'2011-08-19 17:06:38',	'',	0,	'http://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=139',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

Gayundin, ang Pilipinas ay may Filipino. Hindi ako isang linggwistiko na eksperto sa pinagmulan ng wikang Filipino at ang kanyang porma. Ngunit alam kong ito ang wika ng ating bayan; ang wika na ginamit ng mga bayani na siyang nakipaglaban sa mga mananakop upang makamtam ang minimithing kalayaan. Ang wikang ito ay nagmula sa ating mga ninuno na siyang ginamit sa pakikipag-usap sa araw-araw. Ang wikang ito ang bunga ng tradisyon at kultura ng ating bayan. Ang wika na siyang sumisimbulo kung sino tayo- mga Pilipinong malaya.\n\nKaya naman ganun na lamang ang aking pagkadismaya at pagkalungkot sa ilang mga Pilipinong kung tratuhin ang ating pinakamamahal na wika na parang basura. Sabihin na lang natin na oo, sa pangangailangan ng makabagong panahon ay kailangan natin matuto ng Ingles upang magkaroon ng komunikasyon sa ibang mga tao lalo na ang mga banyaga. Pero sinasabi ko sa kahit sinuman, na hindi ibig sabihin na kapag ika\'y magaling magsalita ng Ingles ay isa kang intelihenteng tao. Siguro\'y nagtutunog matalino ka ngunit hanggang sa pandinig lamang iyon. At sinisiguro ko ring walang katotohanan na ang Ingles ay siyang wika ng karunungan. Kung gayon at sinasabi iyan ng iilan, ibig ba nitong sabihin, ang mga taong hindi nagsasalita ng Ingles ay mangmang? Ilan ba ang hindi gumagamit ng Ingles? Sa Tsina pa lamang, mahigit isang bilyon na. Ibig ba nitong sabihin, wala sila silang sapat na karunungan gaya ng mga taong nagsasalita ng Ingles?\n\nNaalala ko noong ako\'y nag-aaral ng isang asignaturang Filipino noong kolehiyo, pinag-aralan namin sa isang estadistika na maraming mga pamantasan sa probinsiya ang bagamat hindi kilala ay maganda ang estado sa board exams. Nang alamin kung paano sila natututo, sinabi ng pakultad na nagsisimula siyang magturo ng Ingles. Kapag ang mag-aaral ay hindi na makaintindi, magtuturo siya ng Tagalog. Kapag hindi pa rin makaintindi, isasalin niya ang kanyang turo sa Bicolano. Doon natututo ang mga estudyante sa pakikipag-usap sa sariling wika. Mahirap ipilit ang mga bagay na hindi talaga kabilang sa ating pagka-Pilipino, dahil hindi rin ito natural na kabilang sa ating pagkatao.\n\nBakit, kapag ba gusto mong matuto sa Matematika, Agham, Kasaysayan o anumang disiplina, kailangang marunong kang mag-Ingles para gumaling? Hindi ka ba gagaling kapag sarili mong wika ang gagamitin? Ang mga mayayamang bansa gaya ng Hapon, Korea, France, Germany, Saudi Arabia atbp., huwag natin silang mamaliitin na hindi marurunong dahil hindi nila ginagamit ang Ingles at pinagyaman nila ang sarili nilang wika. Mahal ng kanilang mamamayan ang kanilang wika at umunlad sila gamit ito.\n\nSa personal kong karanasan, alam kong kulang ang ginagawa ng gobyerno at akademiya na palaganapin ang wikang Filipino sa kanilang mga sistema ngunit alam ko ring mayroon silang ginagawa para paunlarin ito. Alam kong maraming pwersa ang nagbabanggaan kung ano ba talagang wika ang dapat bigyang prayoridad na matutunan dahil na rin sa globalisasyon. Pero kapag ika\'y lumabas at saan man magpunta dito sa Pilipinas, ang natural na wika pa ring ginagamit ay Filipino- hindi lamang ng mga tindera, tsuper, katulong, kundi lahat ng mga Pilipino. Ang wikang Ingles ay maaaring makapagpakita na tayo\'y may iba pang wikang alam. Ngunit mas malakas pa rin ang tawag ng ating pagka-Pilipino kahit saan man tayong lugar sa mundo mapunta.\n\nKaya ito lamang ang masasabi ko sa taong halos sambahin na ang banyaga at itapon ang sariling wika: Kung hindi dahil sa wikang ginamit ng ating mga bayani upang ipaglaban ang ating bayan, malamang ika\'y nabubuhay na alipin pa rin. Ngunit siguro nga, maging alipin ng banyaga ang gusto mong gawin sa buhay mo. Sa kasamaang palad at riyalidad, wala namang pakialam ang tao kung marunong kang mag-Ingles o kung ano pa mang wikang banyaga ang alam mo. Ang importante ay marunong kang makisama, makipag-usap at makaintindi sa kapwa ng walang panlalapastangan. At huwag kang umastang akala mo\'y kung sino kang marunong at superyor, kasi mas matalino ang sambayanang Pilipino kaysa sayo. Meron ka na bang napatunayan sa pag-i-Ingles mo? Kung susumahin, ilan ka ba sa bansang ito na itinakwil ang wikang Filipino? Isa? Ilan naman ang ininsulto mong tao dahil sa mababang pagtingin mo sa sariling wika? Hmm.. mga 90 milyong Pilipino? Kung si Dr. Jose Rizal ay babangon mula sa kanyang libingan at nalamang isa kang Atenista na itinakwil ang iyong pagka-Pilipino, malamang sa malamang, itatakwil ng ating pambansang bayani ang kanyang pagiging Atenista. Noong sinabi ni Rizal na ang taong hindi marunong magmahal sa sariling wika ay mas masahol pa sa malansang isda, hindi naman niya literal na tinutukoy ang amoy ng isda. Masyadong mababaw iyon. Ibig lamang niyang sabihin, hindi kailangan ng Pilipinas ng mga elitisang mangmang at hambog gaya mo.

Pineda</span></span></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">IT\'S already February 2012 and the impeachment trial of Chief Justice Renato Corona is still the highlight of everyday events in the government and media. But unlike Jeremy Lin\'s sudden hype because of his skill, [1] the impeachment is like a paid advertisement to sway people\'s minds to rebel against “betrayal of public trust.” However, even though the Filipinos have a hasty generalization mentality, day by day it changes due to extreme lack of capability both skill and evidence that the prosecution has been showing in the trial. [11]</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> Not a few people will conclude that whoever is against the President of the Republic is a pro-GMA person. You can see that everywhere in argumentation in social networking and media sites. It has always been argued that we deem wanted GMA to be liable for her sins to the country. Yes, I agree with these people 100%. If needed, then she should give back all the money she has allegedly stolen from the Filipinos and pay the price of her crimes in jail. But I always say that GMA is just one small part of the story of the Filipinos. Furthermore, saying that if you\'re anti-GMA then you should be pro-PNoy is such an illogical statement.</span></span></div>\n<div align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><strong>On the GMA Case</strong> </span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> In the first place, I don\'t agree with how the government handled her arrest and even stopped her from leaving the country last November 2011. The issue there wasn\'t whether she will escape the country or not. The issue was whether the government followed the rule of law or not. [12] Let\'s always remember that the court would and should never rule based on speculations. Speculations include thinking that she will just escape or faking her illness. If that were true then there should be evidence. There was even no formal case filed by the government against her. Better yet, let\'s put ourselves in her shoes being barred from leaving the country even though no formal charge was filed. You\'re being blocked because of speculations. Wouldn\'t that sound unfair? It is not the fault of the court that they allowed GMA to leave. It is the fault of the government for failing to file a formal case against GMA. PNoy has been in his throne for more than a year already before this incident happen. He could\'ve tasked his officials to spend time filing cases against GMA. But he spent those time just bragging and blaming the previous administration in his SONA justifying that he cannot do much because the government funds were missing. He spent his time being a pot calling the kettle black.</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> In the February 23, 2012 trial of CJ Corona, Senator Gringo Honasan asked clarificatory questions to DOJ Sec. Leila De Lima regarding her disobedience on the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) issue on the GMA case. De Lima explained that the DOJ Circular 41 gave them the power to issue a Watch List Order (WLO) to hold GMA. She admitted she defied the TRO and proceeded to block her. Sen. Honasan asked if there should be a “probable cause” in determining whether an individual should be placed under WLO. The Secretary said no. But since she defied the TRO issued by the court, she was given a show-cause order why she shouldn\'t be held for contempt. The Senator then asked, why a show-cause order is needed. De Lima replied, “because there is due process.” </span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> How easy it is for the DOJ Secretary to issue a WLO without even determining a probable cause yet when she\'s the one with criminal liability, she\'s given a proper time to explain herself because of due process.</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> Days after the TRO incident, on November 18, 2011, the Pasay Regional Trial Court (RTC), after recommendation from the DOJ-Comelec joint panel, issued a warrant of arrest against GMA. This move made the TRO useless and created a probable cause against GMA. [7] However, ask yourself this: Is this how the court handles a case against an accused? The moment, the same day the recommendation from the joint panel was released, the court has already determined a probable cause against the respondent. If you go to the Comelec office, you would see a lot of voluminous documents on the case yet they were able to issue an arrest warrant within 2 hours. Are they fast readers and fast typists? Days ago, the government was questioned on legal basis. In this case, they made the process look legal through technicalities. But would you call that due process? In the first place, would you call that ethical?</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> Of all these Filipino cases, how many of them are being attended to and being determined with a probable cause in just 2-hours? </span></span></div>\n<div align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><strong>On the Corona case</strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> PNoy\'s hate on Corona sitting as Chief Justice was first felt during the Presidential Inauguration when he chose Associate Justice Conchita Carpio-Morales to administer the oath-taking ceremony instead of the CJ. [8] He continued mentioning the midnight appointment of Corona and how his appointment will become a hindrance to the administration\'s plans for reform.</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> I personally didn\'t like Corona to become the Chief Justice when appointed by GMA on 2010. I believe that he shouldn\'t have even accepted the position. I wanted Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio [13] become the CJ. I\'ve read his profile and decisions made and all were superb. Of course, in a legal argumentation, 2 lawyers will have 2 opposite arguments that have good points. For one side, a president can appoint a CJ when one vacates it. It so happened that CJ Puno\'s mandatory retirement was on May 2010 which was an election month. [14] On another side, there shouldn\'t be no appointments due to election ban. Two arguments both found in the constitution. And so the appointment became legal after decided by the Supreme Court. But I don\'t really think that it\'s the end of the world for PNoy. For me, what happened was part of democracy. One part of the government cannot always be on the same page of the other parts.</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> The President have been so consistent in criticizing and lambasting the CJ. The Judiciary, on the other hand, has always been silent and the least expressive to the public. The sympathy of the public went to the President especially because the CJ was appointed by an unpopular president. The President in return continued his acts.</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> Then came the Criminal Justice Summit on December 6, 2011 wherein both the CJ and the President attended. Instead of giving a talk on Criminal Justice, the President slammed the Chief Justice and the Supreme Court in its face. The CJ just kept silent, emotionless and calm. [6] But it was a sign that the President really wanted the CJ out. </span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> One week later, 188 Congressmen signed an impeachment complaint of Corona. He was impeached by the House of Representatives on 8 Articles of Impeachment. [5] It was a very fast move, just like how an arrest warrant was issued against GMA. Eight articles of impeachment were read, verified and signed by more than 188 representatives within 5 hours and transmitted to Senate.</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> The trial began before the Senate even started. After filing the impeachment complaint, members of the prosecution panel led by the Justice Committee Chair Niel Tupas Jr., they claimed that the CJ has amassed ill-gotten wealth and various properties beyond his capacity to pay as a Chief Justice. Days before the trial, the Land Registration Authority (LRA) released records and claimed that CJ Corona has 45 properties. These properties were disclosed by the prosecution team in a press conference.</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> For Malacañang\'s part, the President admitted urging the Congressmen to file the impeachment complaint. I really feel that they were expecting Corona to resign because the plaintiff admittedly claimed that impeachment complaint is very weak. [31] Other signatories of the complaint also admitted that they didn\'t read the whole contents of the complaint and just relied on the Powerpoint made by Tupas. [20] PNoy for his part started drafting replacements for Corona even when the impeachment hadn\'t started yet. [21]</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> They never knew that CJ Corona will not give up easy and fight back. The Chief Justice answered all allegations one by one and even fired back to his critiques. High profile lawyers offered legal services pro-bono to defend him. [22]</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> And the prosecution team with more than 50 private lawyers have been humiliated publicly due to their lack of preparation and fishing expedition. They cried foul when Retired Associate Justice Serafin Cuevas, lead defense counsel, [2] had been very strict in following rules of court and evidence. He has been objecting a lot silencing the prosecution and ruining their plans of presenting a lot of witnesses and evidences which Cuevas claims as “immaterial, irrelevant and impertinent.” </span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> The reason why I\'m personally against the removal of Chief Justice Corona in the Supreme Court is simply the cases filed were so weak that the accusers didn\'t even have any idea about what they complained about. [15] They\'re just pulling up people issuing subpoena to whoever they wanted. It pains me to see how these politicians embarrass a person without any concrete basis. But in a wider scope, the President is trying to become a dictator- first by controlling the executive, second by controlling the legislative and now trying to control the judiciary. This plan is contrary to what democracy speaks about. He wants everybody in the government agree with him. If not, he/she will be impeached or terminated. The worst part is, these offices affected by the impeachment focus more on the impeachment rather than their primary work- the Senate, the Congress (who has only 2 sessions in quorum last January), [32] the Judiciary (especially the Supreme Court) and the Office of the President.</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> So the question is: Is this the government that we want? A government that chases the allegedly bad without the due process? A government that promotes character assassination? A government, which Senator Bongbong Marcos defines, that enforces “selective justice?” [16]</span></span></div>\n<div align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><strong>On the Filipino case</strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> Supposed GMA and Corona both are sent to jail hypothetically, what good will it bring to the Filipino people? Freedom? Growth in economy? Trust in government? [4] You answer.</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> The problem with the President is that he is too busy and obsessed catching who he thinks is bad to attain peace. He wanted to build a “matuwid na daan.” However, catching bad guys is supposedly the norm. Meaning to say, it should be given that for a country, it is peaceful. It is not something to brag or to give so much limelight. Because for Filipinos, a straight path is just the same with a zigzag path. Those are just 2 roads. Catching the bad guys won\'t bring the poor out of hunger. Putting GMA in jail won\'t increase the economic growth. Ousting Corona won\'t lower the oil prices and the primary commodities.</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> My point is simple. Let the courts handle these cases. End of story. Focus more on building the country and not focus on persecuting individual people. They are entitled to due process and presumption of innocence for God\'s sake.</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> The economy drastically went down months right after PNoy stepped in Malacañang. [9] He focused on a crusade to battle the corrupt but only there. He tighten the release of the taxpayer\'s money because he doesn\'t want the money to go in the pockets of the corrupt. But if you will not let the money go into cycle, then there won\'t be any improvements in the country at all. This is what is happening.</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> The unemployment rate is higher. [10] Children who go to school are lower. [17] Basic commodities are getting higher as well but he is not doing anything about it. If he\'s doing something about it, nobody knows. What people see in television is his love life and campaign against GMA and Corona. </span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> Does he have any concrete projects that are being/already implemented? If there are, what are they? Please don\'t tell me Condition Cash Transfers (CCT) amounting to PHP 21 Billion annually. [30]</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> Specifically, he must address concerns on education, employment, environment and technology. There are so many projects that can be done for those categories mentioned. But I see none. </span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> It\'s true that PNoy is doing selective justice. He does what he wants. He will humiliate anybody who is against him and defy the rule of law. There is no accountability on his part also. I remember the Qurino Grandstand Hostage taking last August 2010. A lot of Chinese tourists where killed including the hostage taker. The President didn\'t apologize for what happened because he said his administration did its best to help. [28] But did they? The Undersecretary for DILG Rico Puno was not terminated even if he didn\'t act properly during the hostage crisis. Puno is close friend who help campaigned him in the elections. [29]</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> When the presidential speech writer Mai Mislang tweeted various derogatory statements regarding Vietnam during their State Visit there, she was even defended by the President. [3] When his “kabarilan” Sec. Ronald Llamas was caught buying pirated DVD\'s and his car caught with an AK-47 rifle, he wasn\'t fired. As a matter of fact, the President defended him. [24][26]</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> When the NBI Director Magtanggol Gatdula, was allegedly involved in a kidnapping of a Japanese alien, without proper conference or meeting, he was kicked out and humiliated in his office. Gatdula filed a TRO seeking to stop a preliminary investigation which perceived to be biased because of the DOJ panel doing reviews without getting his side. The court sided with Gatdula and issued a TRO. But the great Leila De Lima didn\'t follow it and continued with her investigation. [25]</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> The Retired Lieutenant Jovito Palparan who was accused by the government for kidnapping and killing of student activists was issued a WLO by the DOJ. He was following and attending the hearings set for him. When the WLO expired, he wanted to leave the country. Even if there are no pending cases on him and the WLO has already expired, he was still barred by Sec. De Lima. [27]</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> I mentioned these things because the President\'s campaign is for public trust and accountability. He tries to use force and power to put down his enemies who he thinks are criminals without the due process. But as you can see, he himself runs a corrupted administration. He doesn\'t discipline or admonish incompetent and sinful officials he appointed for as long as they\'re his friends and do things that pleases him. While personal vendetta is being promoted, who in the 90 million Filipino people are benefiting from it? </span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> With all fairness to GMA, she did bring the economy through BPO\'s. She did build those roads in the North. She did something. [23] Public office is public trust. But public office has also other tasks other than establishing it as a public trust. In its essence it says for service of the public, not for the service of personal interests.</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> I\'m deeply dismayed and bothered that our President has been a spoiled brat doing what he pleases in bigotry and conceitedness. Enough is said during the Sendong when he was partying when his people are dying in Mindanao. [33] Enough is said that he there was a flood control project there which he scrapped because it was GMA\'s project. Enough is said that he vetoed budget for Disaster Management program in the National Budget. [34]</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> What is next Mr. President? I respect democracy and I respect the millions of people who voted for PNoy. But he must serve not only for those who voted for him. When I chance upon my ITR I saw I paid more than a 100,000 Pesos for taxes yet I don\'t see even little improvements in our country. All I see and hear are complains and blames because of the corrupt past administration. </span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> I hope it\'s not all about politics and media sensation. The Filipinos deserve more than that. In the end I ask this current government, What makes you different from what you say is a corrupt administration if yourselves don\'t follow the law, protect your own and neglect the needs of your people?</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> The President is elected for the Filipino people and not to chase Arroyo and Corona. </span></span></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><strong>References:</strong></span></span></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">[1] Linforgraphic: The journey of Jeremy Lin by Inforgraphic World from http://infographicworld.com/linfographic-the-journey-of-jeremy-lin/</span></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">[2] When the going gets tough, the tough get going by Fil V.

(156,	1,	'2014-01-07 17:06:09',	'2014-01-07 17:06:09',	'\n				PALASAK na ang mga balita tungkol sa mga pa-VIP na ayaw pumila o mga naka-tinted na kotseng naka-convoy na ayaw ma-trapik kahit tanghali na bumangon. Kamakailan lang ay naisiwalat sa mga peryodiko, radyo at telebisyon ang video ni Mayor Binay na gumamit ng pagka-VIP upang masapawan ang mga alituntunin sa Dasmarinas Village at mangibabaw ang kanyang kapangyarihan. Siya ay nanaig. Pinuri ang mga guwardiyang pinairal ang mga polisiya sa subdivision at inulan naman ng batikos ang magaling na Mayor.  May iba pa bang tao bukod kay Binay ang ganito ang asal?\n\n<strong>\"Mayaman ako. May driver ako. May body guard akong may baril. Dito ako paparada.\"</strong>\n\nAlam naman natin na sa Kalakhang Maynila, partikular sa  Maynila, Makati, Taguig (BGC) at karatig pang mga lungsod, ay hindi madaling makakuha ng parking slot. Ultimo sa kalsada ka magparada, may bayad at oras ang pagpaparada. HIndi ka pwedeng lumagpas sa oras o sumobra ng parada sa linya na nakapinta sa sahig. Tiyak ito-towang kotse at ika\'y pagmumultahin. Ikukulong ang iyong sasakyan hanggang ito\'y iyong matubos at kung malasi\'y mayroon na itong gasgas o sira pagkakuha mo sa impounding center.\n\nAt marami na ring naibalita patungkol sa pagpapatayan dahil lamang sa agawan sa parking slot. Hindi ba isang kahibangan na pag-awayan ang isang napakababaw na bagay?\n\nKapag nagpunta ka sa Makati, partikular na sa Ayala Center (Glorietta, Shangri-La, Greenbelt etc.), makikita mo na andami-daming MAPSA (traffic enforcer ng Makati/yellow boys), Ayala Center guards, pulis, kawani ng baranggay etc. Maraming nakabantay upang panatilihan ang kaayusan sa lugar. Hinuhuli nila ang mga hindi sumusunod sa batas-trapiko at mga pasaway.\n\nNgunit pansinin niyo kapag nagawi kayo sa may Rustan\'s (Glorietta area, Couryard Dr. at Office Dr.) at sa gilid ng Glorietta 3 park sa tapat ng Shangri-La, nagkalat na nakapila ang mga magagarang mga sasakyan. Karamihan dyan ay mga Land Cruiser, Camry, Benz, Expedition, BMW etc. Nakapila na naghihintay. May mga driver ang iba, ang iba nama\'y sadyang ipinarada na lang doon ang sasakyan. Makikita mong sinasaway sila ng mga enforcer ngunit hinahayaan lang naman din sila. May iba pa na nakaparada mismo sa may nakapaskil na \"No parking/No stopping anytime. Tow-away zone.\" Tignan nyo ang lugar na \'yan lalo na sa gabi, kung kailan uwian na ang mga tao galingsa trabaho at sobrang trapik. Diyan mo makikita ang mga sasakyan na lalong nagpapalala sa trapiko.\n\nGayundin, pumunta kayo sa Little Tokyo sa may Pasong Tamo sa Makati. Mas grabe ang sitwasyon. Double parking sa magkabilang daanan. Makikita mo roon, sobrang trapik na talaga dahil ang sikip na ng kalye. Ang aangas pa ng mga pumaparada sa daan. Ibababa ang sakay sa gitna ng daan (karamiha\'y mga Hapon). Hindi sila tumatabi. Hindi uso ang pagtabi at pag-hazard. Pagkatapos, mag-assist ang barker, mag-mamaniubra ng alanganin na halos masagi na ang ibang naperwisyong sasakyan. Hindi iyan magbibigay kahit alanganin siya. Minsan, mag-counterflow pa iyang mga iyan na hindi mo maintindihan. Mag-high beam pa.\n\nAng kabalintunaan sa dalawang pangyayaring ito ay: 1) Bawal talagang maghintay o pumarada sa daanan. Ito ay dapat sinusunod ng lahat; at 2) Ilang metro lang ay parking area.  Kadalasan, P45 ang unang 2 hanggang 4 na oras.\n\nAng hindi ko maintindihan sa mga taong ito ay kung bakit ayaw nila pumarada sa tamang lugar at kailangang doon sila sa kalsada. Samantalang ang mga ordinaryong mga tao ay sumusunod naman. Minsan nga\'y ang mga ordinaryo at mga working/middle class ang napagbubuntunan ng power tripping ng mga pulis.\n\nAnong gustong palabasin ng mga taong ito? Siguro nama\'y hindi nila gagawing dahilan na wala silang pambayad sa parking. Aba\'y kaya nilang bumili ng mga BMW at Land Cruiser. Ang dating lang sa akin, gusto nilang sabihin at iparating na: \"Kaya kong pumuwesto kahit saan ko gusto dahil mayaman o makapangyarihan ako\" at \"Hindi ako madadaan sa mga pag-aresto at pagmulta dahil marami akong koneksyon at kaya kitang ipatanggal sa trabaho.\" Marami pang ibang mga pahayag na ganyan ang konteksto.\n\nKaya kung tatanungin, marami bang katulad ni Binay na ganyan kahambog, power tripper at abusado sa kapangyarihan? Kung sa Glorietta at Little Tokyo pa lang, naku napakarami na! Paano pa kaya sa ibang lugar, hindi ba?\n\n<strong>Diskriminasyon sa kapwa Pilipino batay sa yaman at pagiging dayuhan</strong>\n\n<b> </b>Isa itong halatang obserbasyon ko sa karamihan sa ating mga Pilipino. Malakas talaga ang colonial mentality. Naka-ilang restaurant na rin ang aking napuntahan kung saan may mga kasabay kaming mga dayuhan gaya ng Amerikano, Breton, Aleman etc. Kung mapapansin ninyo, parehas naman kayo (ikaw at ang dayuhan) na kostumer, parehas naman kayong magbabayad at magbibigay ng tip, ngunit mas inaasikaso pa ang dayuhan kaysa sa inyo. Mas uunahin pang kuhanin at ibigay ang order kahit mas nauna kayo sa pila. Mas maayos ang pakikitungo nila sa dayuhan kaysa sa kapwa nila Pilipino.\n\nNaalala ko tuloy ang nobelang \'Gapo (pinaikling Olongapo) ni Lualhati Bautista. Pinakita roon na talagang Pilipino mismo ang nagbibigay ng diskriminasyon sa kapwa nila Pilipino. Mas aasikasuhin nila ang mga Kano. Samantalang kinakalimutan nila at hindi binibigyan ng maayos o katumbas na serbisyo ang kapwa nila Pilipino. Tama ba naman ba \'yon?\n\nSa palagay ko nga, hindi naman nanghihingi ng espesyal na trato ang mga dayuhang ito. Pilipino mismo ang lumuluhod at sumasamba pa sa mga ito. Hindi ba isa itong malaking katangahan?\n\nKitang-kita iyan araw-araw kung papansinin niyo lang. Sa Ayala na nga lang, lahat nag-underpass tuwing araw para makatawid sa kabila. May Amerikana na nagbukas ng gate sa tawiran sa Ayala upang tumawid. Alam naman nating tuwing gabi lamang ito binubuksan dahil kakaunti na ang mga dumadaang sasakyan. Imbis na hulihin at pagmultahin ang Amerikana dahil ito\'y nag-jaywalking, aba\'y tinulungan pa ito ng dakilang MAPSA! Pero kung Pilipino ang gumawa niyan, tiyak sigaw at multa ang aabutin niyan.\n\nGanyan din  kapag papasok ka sa mall (hal. MOA) o sa LRT/MRT. Lahat ng mga taong pumapasok sa mall o sa estasyon ng tren, tinitignan ang bag at kinakapkapan. Kapag Amerikano na, kulang na lang tanggalin ang lamesa para malaki ang daanan ng dayuhan papasok. Walang kapkap, ngingiti pa ang gwardya at babati ng \"Good morning!\"\n\nSariling kababayan, dinodorobo at binibiktima ng diskriminasyon.\n\nMay diskriminasyon din kapag mayaman, middle class o mahirap ka. Doon sa mga insidente sa Glorietta at Little Tokyo, palagay mo ba kung middle class na naka-Innova ang paparada doon, masisindak niya kaya ang MAPSA o ang pulis? Malamang siguro, isa na siya sa mga na-tow at kung malasi\'y nakulong pa.\n\nIba ang nagagawa ng pera at kapangyarihan sa pagsasakatuparan ng mga alituntunin at batas. Kaya marami talaga ang nag-aasal Binay.\n\n<strong>Gasgasan ang mga sasakyang hindi marunong pumarada sa tama!</strong>\n\nKadalasan, kapag ako\'y nadadaan sa Pasong Tamo, gustong-gusto ko talagang gasgasan gamit ng piso o dulo ng cutter ang lahat ng sasakyan na nakabalandara sa kalsada na nagiging sanhi ng matinding trapiko. Ang dami ko ngang naisip gawin. Gusto kong hampasin ng baseball bat ang side mirror, i-spray paint ang body at tapunan ng pintura ang windshield at butasan ang mga gulong. Ang kakapal kasi ng mga mukha ng mga iyan! Hindi lang kayo ang tao sa Pilipinas. Kung gusto niyong magkalat ng sasakyan niyo, bumili kayo ng sarili ninyong Glorietta at Little Tokyo. Huwag ninyong idamay ang ibang taong gusto lang makauwi sa mga bahay nila.\n\nPara sa mga nagpapaka-alipin sa mga dayuhan na iyan, tapos na ang pananakop ng Kastila, Amerikano at Hapon! Tapos na ang World War 2. Malaya na tayo. Huwag kayong maging MAKAPILI. Mas masahol pa ang ganyang ugali kaysa sa mga mananakop mismo. Aba\'y kapwa Pilipino niyo na ang ginagago niyo. Huwag naman ganun.\n\nPanghuli, ang batas ay para sa lahat. Sana gaya ng pag-apply sa US visa ang pagsagawa at pagsakatuparan ng mga batas. Noong ako ay nag-apply at nasa embahada ng US, ang mga kasabayan ko,: mayaman, kasambahay, matanda, bata, OFW na galing Japan, may syota sa US etc. Pero lahat dadaan sa proseso at tanging consul lamang ang magsasabi kung aprubado o hindi ang visa application. Nasa harap ko sa pila, congressman natin. Walang special lane, walang VIP treatment. Lahat pantay-pantay.\n\nTanggalin na natin ang Asal Binay. Kay Binay na lang \'yan. Kasabay ng pagtanggal sa Asal Binay, itapon na rin natin ang Kulturang Alipin. Hindi tayo alipin ninuman. Malaya tayong mga tao na nakatira sa malayang bayan.

I\'ve also learned most of the routes in going around Makati.\n</span></div>\n<span id=\"yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392790649907_54029\" style=\"font-size:small;\">I am writing this message to you because I really think and feel that it is my duty to inform you about the problems that I\'m observing here in Pasong Tamo near Don Bosco area. I live there nearby.</span>\n\n<strong>Pasong Tamo Traffic</strong>\nWe all know that the Pasong Tamo Rd. is notorious for flooding. I can see that the government is doing some flood control projects that\'s why the Estacion St. (parallel Pasong Tamo) is closed for the project. People also observe the elevation of roads in the Pasay Road area. One side of it is closed due to ongoing construction. I think that is a really good plan.\n\nHowever, I think that the traffic control/congestion worsened. Everyday, there are many irate drivers and long queues from SLEX going to Don Bosco Rd. and in Pasong Tamo (going to Magallanes and vice versa). The MAPSA officers cannot control the traffic because the volume of vehicles are way more than what the street can handle during that time. The bottleneck is Don Bosco Rd. cor Pasong Tamo. Almost majority of vehicles coming from SLEX wants to turn left going to Waltermart/Pasay Road/Buendia. The vehicles from Magallanes are going the<span id=\"yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392790649907_54042\" style=\"font-size:small;\"> same direction. Hence, there\'s a very heavy traffic. As you would know before the construction, Pasong Tamo from Don Bosco Rd. to Waltermart is one way. That\'s why traffic before was controlled.</span>\n\nI only see 2 concrete solutions and I hope this can be considered by the government and traffic enforcers:\n1) Make Pasong Tamo Rd. (at the very least from Don Bosco Rd. to Waltermart) a NO STOPPING ZONE. As you will see, both sides, the right most lane and the left most lane, are occupied by parked vehicles who are either school bus services, cars of parents waiting etc. This cuts the available lanes to 2 which is very small for the volume of vehicles using the road. Traffic enforcers should force the vehicles to move so that the traffic circulates and penalize/tow if they insist on staying. For the past days, these parked vehicles occupy from the start of Don Bosco school to its Pasay Rd side. This causes so much traffic.\n\n2) Permanently close the entrance from expressway going to Don Bosco Rd. or close it at the beginning and ending of all Don Bosco classes. My first suggestion is quite restrictive because not one vehicle can pass through Don Bosco Rd. But this will surely remove unnecessary traffic for those going to Pasong Tamo. I say unnecessary traffic because it\'s a traffic that cannot be controlled by the traffic enforcers. It\'s too much for them to handle because the volume of vehicles is so high. By logic, since the drivers know that the road is closed, they will find for alternative routes. My second suggestion can be seen very effective. The traffic in Pasong Tamo becomes very bad when it\'s the start or end of students\' classes. I suggest close the gate before 7am, 12pm and 4pm to lessen additional traffic. I think the traffic will be lessened big time.\n\nPlease note that during Saturdays, Don Bosco usually has its sports activities like inter-school tournament etc. Not one Saturday was the traffic controlled. There were no traffic enforcers, lots of cars parked along the street and the traffic is like a big and long parking lot in Pasong Tamo.\n\n<strong>Sidewalk issues</strong>\n\nI also would like to report the sidewalks both on Don Bosco side and Waltermart side. On the Don Bosco side, people cannot walk straight because the sidewalk is uneven  damaged and has so many cracks. Mostly students and passers-by affected by this problem. I hope this issue can be resolved because this will be very helpful for all people walking there.\n\nOn the other side, I feel that the Vista residences and Wilcon Depot have violated rules on the sidewalk. Vista condominium is still ongoing and they destroyed the sidewalk flattened and made an inclined angle so that their cement trucks can enter their vicinity. I think this very bad because they park their trucks along the sidewalk and the wet cement flows on the street. The trucks are supposed to be parked in their vicinity and they should\'ve not changed the form of the sidewalk. It\'s not theirs.\n\nWilcon Depot has their own contribution to the worsening traffic in Pasong Tamo and they are also obstructing the sidewalk. First, they don\'t have proper parking area. Vehicles are allowed to turn in any part of their vicinity. If there is no parking, the vehicle waits on the street. They allow triple or sometimes quadruple parking (cars queued up per column) which partly is their space and partly is the sidewalk. Thus, it obstructs the sidewalk and people resort walking to the street instead. For example, when 1 car wants to leave their place and it happens that it\'s infront, they need to move all three cars out to the street so that the car infront can move. All other cars are using the space of the street and adding to the traffic. This is how they are parking the cars - http://www.wilcon.com.ph/content/20-pasong-tamo-makati-city\n\nWilcon Depot should implement an effective parking scheme. I suggest that they can put a vehicle entrance for those unloading/loading. They need space to load the hardware stuff that they buy. And make parking with limited slots. They have to be rational when accommodating cars. If the maximum parking is for 10 slots, they should not allow 50 vehicles park there. Otherwise, it will be chaotic like what is happening now. They can even ask their customers in case the parking is full to park at Waltermart. It\'s covered, it\'s safe and it\'s around 10 steps away.\n\nIf both Vista residences and Wilcon Depot respect the people, they should do something with the problems with the sidewalk. Everyday, lots of students and even employees walk there. There were multiple instances when I nearly got hit by a car that valet personnel from Wilcon Depot was moving.\n<div id=\"yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392790649907_54053\">I hope that this report will go somewhere. I know this is unsolicited but I\'m reporting and suggesting this to improve Makati. There are so many people who are affected with these problems which I believe can be resolved. I think that a perspective from a person who sees it everyday is also helpful other than proclaimed experts in the field of urban planning.</div>\n<div id=\"yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1392790649907_54050\"></div>		',	'Traffic and sidewalk issues along Pasong Tamo',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'traffic-and-sidewalk-issues-along-pasong-tamo',	'',	'',	'2014-02-27 02:06:59',	'2014-02-27 02:06:59',	'',	0,	'http://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=159',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

Dahil kumpleto na rin naman ang statistics, sisimulan ko ang sanaysay kong ito sa mga pinagtatawanang quotable quotes ni Melanie Marquez: [1]\n<ol>\n	<li>I don\'t eat meat, I\'m not a carnival.</li>\n	<li>Why should I have a calling card? I\'m not a call girl</li>\n	<li>You can fool me once, you can even fool me twice, you can even fool me thrice. But you can never fool me four.</li>\n	<li>Nikki, you\'re so galing. You should go to the States. You will sell hotcakes!</li>\n</ol>\nSadyang hinanap ko pa kung talagang totoo ang mga sinabi ni Marquez na kumakalat sa social networking sites. Halos lahat ng nabasa kong komento ay pinagtatawanan siya at ang iba\'y nagsasabing tanga o bobo siya. Mismong news article pa sa ABS-CBN ang sanggunian ng mga kumakalat na memes ni Marquez.\n\nNakakatawa siya sa unang basa ngunit mapapatanong ka, ganyan ba ang batayan para sabihing matalino ka? Kailangan magaling kang mag-Ingles? Subukan mo na lang sumakay ng dyip at makipag-usap ka gamit ang wikang Ingles at papanoorin ka ng mga tao at sa gilid ng isipan ng ila\'y intelihente kang nilalang.\n\nBaliktarin naman natin ang sitwasyon. Sabihin natin na mali-mali ang pagbikas at pagbuo mo ng mga pangungusap sa wikang Filipino. Pagtatawanan ka kaya? Huhusgahan ka kayang mangmang? Siguro, wala lang reaksyon ang mga tao. Basta ang importante\'y naintindihan nila ang gusto mong iparating sa kanila. Ngayon, balikan natin ang mga quotable quotes ni Marquez. Maiintindihan mo pa rin naman siguro ang gusto niyang iparating, di ba? Ginawan lang ng balita kasi sumablay sa Ingles.\n\nAno naman ang relasyon ni Melanie Marquez sa epekto ng CMO 20 sa bansang ito? Kung ngayon pa lamang mababa na ang tingin ng mga Pilipino sa wikang Filipino, paano pa kaya kapag nawala na ito sa kolehiyo? Malaki ang posibilidad na mas lalong sambahin ang wikang Ingles at tuluyan ng makalimutan ang Filipino. Nakikita na nga natin na malaki na ang puwang na dapat sana\'y pinaglalagyan upang masanay at pagyamanin pa ang wika. Ngunit dahil wala na ito, wala ng reinforcement ang mga leksyon tungkol dito.\n\n<strong>\'Di pagiging akma ng wika sa kurso</strong>\n\nMaraming pilosopo ang nagsasabing, \"Computer Science naman ang course ko, bakit pa kailangan ng Filipino?\" Nabasa ko rin ang isa sa mga kolum ni Dr. Antonio Contreras ang isyu ng pagsasalin ng mga terminong teknikal na wala naman katumbas sa Filipino. [2] Halimbawa, isalin mo nga sa wikang Filipino ang \"cellular automata\" o \"vulnerability management.\" Tama namang walang mga katumbas ang mga salitang teknikal na nabanggit sa ngayon. Ngunit mayroong dalawang punto na importanteng dapat isaalang-alang.\n\nUna, mas madaling matututo ang estudyante kapag ginagamit ang wikang Filipino (o wikang lokal/dayalekto) dahil wala ng code switching na tinatatwag. Napatunayan na itong argumentong ito sa iba\'t ibang pahayagan kung saan ang isang hindi kilalang pamantasan sa Bicol ay nakakapagtala ng maraming pumapasa sa board exams sa engineering atbp. [3] Personal ko rin itong nararanasan sa pagtuturo lalo na kung mayroong tanong ang estudyante tungkol sa paksang aming tinatalakay.\n\nPangalawa, sa aking pananaw ay masyado pang bata ang ating wika kaya marami pa itong oportunindad upang lumago. Siguro\'y wala pang katumbas ang mga salitang teknikal na iyan. Ngunit darating ang panahon na sa tulong ng mga eksperto sa wikang Filipino ay madagdagan ang ating bokabularyo sa mga teknikal na salita na sinalin na.\n\n<strong>Mawawalan kasi ang mga propesor ng trabaho kaya sila nagwewelga</strong>\n\nIto naman ang sinasabi ng mga administrador ng iba\'t ibang mga pamantasan maging ang CHED. Ayon nga sa statistics ni Prop. David San Juan ng DLSU, mahigit kumulang 10,000 full-time at 20,000 part-time na mga propesor ang mawawalan ng trabaho o mababawasan ng kita. Mababawasan ng kita o demotion ang kanilang kahihinatnan dahil ililipat ang iba sa grade 11 at 12. [6]\n\nTama namang sabihing isa sa mga dahilan ang sweldo. Wala na kasing magiging ranking pagdating sa grade 11-12 hindi tulad sa pamantasan. Ngunit ganoon na lamang ba dapat maging tingin sa mga propesor na ito? Pera lang?\n\nIsipin na lang natin, sa dinami-dami ng kursong maaari nilang kunin, bakit naman BA Filipino/MA Filipino/PhD Filipino pa? Maaari naman silang kumuha ng kursong madaling kumita ng pera, hindi ba? Marami rin klaseng mga dalubhasa sa Filipino ang mayroon tayo. Mayroong mga dalubhasang para sa elementarya o high school. Mayroon din namang mga dalubhasa na para sa kolehiyo. Ang papel ng mga propesor sa Filipino ay hindi lamang magturo ng asignaturang Filipino. Mayroong silang misyon na paunlarin at pagyamanin pa lalo ang wika at kulturang Filipino.\n\nIba na ang tema na pinag-uusapan kapag nasa kolehiyo na at ang mga propesor na ito (mga PhD pa karamihan) ang humahawak ng pagpapalaganap ng Filipino. Gaya na lamang ng aking nabasang libro na bunga ng pagsasaliksik ni Dr. Fanny A. Garcia. Isa si Garcia sa mga pinakanirerespeto at iniidolo kong propesor. Sa isa sa mga bago niyang akda, \"Pamilya Migrasyon Disintegrasyon\" kanyang siniyasat ang buhay ng babaeng OFW sa Saudi Arabia at ang epekto nito sa kanyang pamilyang naiwan sa Pilipinas. Malaki ang kaugnayan ng kanyang saliksik sa nangyayari ngayon sa bansa natin sapagkat maraming mga OFW ang nawawalay sa pamilya. [4] Ngayon, ibabalik ko ang tanong, kung ililipat ang mga eksperto at mananaliksik sa grade 11-12, magkakaroon kaya sila ng panahon at pondo para makapagsaliksik ng gaya ng nabanggit? Sa palagay ko, mawawala lahat ng mga iyan at ito ang magiging mitya ng pagkabulok at paghinto ng agos ng wika at kulturang Filipino.\n\n<strong>Academic Freedom ng pamatansan ang bahala kung may Filipino o wala</strong>\n\nNasa saligang batas ng Pilipinas (1987 Philippine Constitution) ang paggamit ng wikang Filipino sa pagtuturo. Ito ay nasa Artikulo 14, Seksyon 6: \" The national language of the Philippines is Filipino. As it evolves, it shall be further developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages. Subject to provisions of law and as the Congress may deem appropriate, the Government shall take steps to initiate and sustain the use of Filipino as a medium of official communication and as language of instruction in the educational system.\" [5]\n\nNgunit iba ang sinasabi ng batas pagdating sa kolehiyo o higher learning. May kalayaang pumili ang mga pamantasan ng kanilang medium of instruction. Artikulo 14, Seksyon 5.2: \"Academic freedom shall be enjoyed in all institutions of higher learning.\" [5] Sa madaling salita, mga kolehiyo na ang bahala kung paano nila isasagawa ang mga curricula nila.\n\nMaaari rin namang tignan ang academic freedom sa anggulong, \"Dahil may academic freedom kami, lalagyan ko ng Filipino subject ang mga kurso sa aming pamantasan.\" Ngunit dahil hindi na ito mandato ng CHED at sa palagay ng mga administrador na hindi kailangan ang Filipino, wala ng hakbang pa para ilaban ito. Para suportahan ang punto ko, bakit sa Malaysia at Indonesia, may asignatura pa rin sila sa wika pagdating ng kolehiyo? Gayundin, bakit ang mga pangunahing unibersidad sa US at maging sa mundo gaya ng Harvard, Yale at Stanford ay mayroong asignaturang Ingles pa rin sa kolehiyo? [6]\n\n<strong>Problema sa identidad ng Filipino</strong>\n\nHanggang ngayon, nagtatalo-talo pa rin kung ano ba talaga ang wikang Filipino? Ito ba ay Tagalog? Paano naman daw ang Cebuano na dominante sa Visayas? Ano ba ang tama, kwaderno o notbuk? Kwiz o pagsusulit o quiz?\n\nNaalala ko noon, tinuro sa amin sa high school na ang sari-sari ay mali dahil wala namang salitang \'sari\' kaya nararapat na tanggalin ang gitling at gawing sarisari. Ngunit kamakailan lang, aking nakumpirma na nasa UP Diksiyonaryong Filipino ang sari-sari. Ano ba talaga ang tama? Pilipinas ba o Filipinas?\n\nNapabili ako ng libro ni Virgilio Almario, Pambansang Alagad ng Sining at dekano ng kolehiyo ng Arte at Letra sa UP-Diliman, na pinamagatang \"F_l_p_no ng mga F_l_p_no\" at mas lalo akong natuto at naguluhan sa pabago-bago ng anyo ng mga salitang Filipino. Sobrang strikto ni Almario Halibawa rito ay ang hindi niya pagtanggap ng salitang \'bentahe\' na dapat ay mainam\' o \'tungkulin\' imbis na \'responsibilidad.\' [7]\n\nAng punto ko lamang sa problema sa identidad ay mas lalong lalawak ang dami ng tanong dahil mawawala ang pag-aaral dito ng husto kung mawawala ang asignaturang Filipino. Sino na ang magtatalo-talo? Ang mga tanong ay maiiwang mga tanong na lamang. Sino na lamang ang magdadagdag at magsasaliksik upang dumami ang bokabularyong Filipino? Gaya ng sinabi ko sa naunang punto, masyadong bata ang ating wika para bitawan na lamang ng ganun na lang.\n\n<strong>Wala sa Ingles ang pag-angat, nasa galing \'yan</strong>\n\nMarami na akong naririnig na mga taong naniniwala na kagalingan sa Ingles ang susi sa pag-angat at pag-unlad sa buhay. Naalala ko noong maliit pa ako, pinapabasa ako ng mga pahayagan at libro sa Ingles. Maganda naman at intensyong lumawak ang bokabularyo. Pero base sa aking karanasan, wala sa Ingles ang pag-unlad kung hindi nasa kahusayan sa espesyalisasyon mo.\n\nNagkaroon ako ng boss na Indiano. Barok-barok mag-Ingles at minsa\'y ala-Melanie Marquez quotable quotes ang dating. Ngunit hindi naman namin siya tinignan na mangmang o walang alam. Magaling siya sa trabaho niya kaya siya ang naging boss namin. Mayroon din akong ka-opisina na Hapon, Pranses at Arabo. Nahihirapan silang magsalita ng Ingles pero ang tataas naman ng katungkulan nila. Hindi naman din consistent ang kanilang balarila na tama. Bakit naman sila napunta sa posisyon na iyon \'di ba?\n\nSa madaling salita, hindi Ingles ang susi ng tagumpay. Maaaring katulong ang Ingles ngunit mas matimbang pa rin ang kahusayan sa trabaho.\n\n<strong>Wikang Filipino: Paalala na tayo\'y mga Pilipinong malaya</strong>\n\nIsa sa importanteng layunin ng asignaturang Filipino sa kolehiyo ay ang pagmulat sa mga mag-aaral ng mga nangyayari sa tunay na buhay at kung papaano ito harapin. Talamak pa rin sa atin ang colonial mentality at ang halos pagsamba sa mga gawang banyaga o banyagang tao mismo. Hindi ko nga alam kung may \"slave complex\" tayong mga Pinoy na para bang kailangang bigyan ng espesyal na trato lagi ang mga banyagang ito kahit na nasa Pilipinas sila. Halimbawa na lamang ay ang pag-inspeksyon sa mga bag at pagkapkap sa mga taong papasok sa mall o MRT. Pansinin ninyo na kapag Pinoy ang papasok, normal na pag-inspeksyon ang ginagawa ng mga guwardiya. Pero kapag Amerikano na ang papasok, talagang VIP ang trato (hindi naman sa lahat ng pagkakataon), wala ng inspeksyon na gagawin at babatiin pa ng \"Good morning sir. How can we help?\"\n\nIsa ang isyung ito sa maraming mga isyung tinatalakay at mahalagang layunin ng asignaturang Filipino sa kolehiyo. Hindi lang ito usaping wika kung hindi usapin ng pagiging Pilipino natin.\n\nSa huli, ano namang masama na magdagdag ka ng 3 hanggang 9 na units na Filipino sa kolehiyo. Hindi naman kabigatan sa bulsa ng magulang iyan dahil noon pa ma\'y mayroon ng Filipino. Balakid ba ang Filipino sa ASEAN integration? Hindi ba ito\'y magiging dagdag kaalaman para sa mga bisita nating mga banyaga? Kahit saan namang bansang may sariling wika, kailangan mo rin naman itong aralin.\n\nHindi direktang magkakaroon ng epekto ang pagtanggal ng asignaturang Filipino sa kolehiyo kung ang batayan ay ang kursong teknikal na pinili mo. Ang epekto nito ay direktang pinupuntirya ang pagkatao ng bawat Filipino. Ang masaklap nito, malamang sa malamang ay hindi na tayo makakapiglas sa paikot-ikot lang na pagbalewala sa Filipino at ang pagbibigay-pansin lamang sa Ingles. Habambuhay na lang na ayos lang na maging mali-mali sa Filipino basta dalubhasa ka sa Ingles. Habambuhay na ang tingin sa mga Inglesero at Inglesera\'y mga matatalino\'t sosyal. Habambuhay rin na tingin na kapag diretso kang magsalita ng Filipino\'y ang lalim mo magsalital kahit hindi naman.\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Babae 1: Do you where the powder room is? I need to change my apparel for the meeting later.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Reaksyon: Wow sosyal! Kailangan masigurong malinis ang CR!</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Babae 2: Ate, pabili naman ako ng abaniko, \'yung kulay bughaw.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Reaksyon: Grabe naman si ate, ang lalim mag-Tagalog.</em></p>\n            Mabuti pa siguro ang ibang sektor, hindi man pormal ang kanilang koneksyon sa gobyerno at akademya\'y nakakapag-ambag sila ng mga bagong salita. Gaya na lang halimbawa ng- \"jupang-pang, cheapangga, jongoloids, shokot, junakis atbp. [8] Ang pag-usbong ng \'Beki\' language na mas nakakapagpakulay pa ng ating wika at angkop pa sa panahon natin ngayon.\n\nSana bago tuluyang maipatupad ang CMO 20, maisip ng CHED kung makabubuti ito sa pangkabuuan at panghinaharap ng bansa at hindi \"for compliance lang.\" Tiyak ang CMO 20 ang magbabali ng mga munting sanga na pagnalao\'y pati katawan ng nagsisimula pa lamang na puno ng wikang Filipino. Kaya CHED, anetch, tsutsugihin niyo ba ang Filipino para bobonikles at ma-jubelita tayong lahat?\n\nSanggunian:\n\n[1] 10 most memorable Melanie Marquez quotes from http://abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/03/10/14/10-most-memorable-melanie-marquez-quotes\n\n[2] Filipino, ang pambansang wikang dapat pang ipaglaban from http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/376423/opinion/blogs/filipino-ang-pambansang-wikang-dapat-pang-ipaglaban\n\n[3] Ang Walang Katapusang Balitaktakan hinggil sa Wikang Pambansa at sa Wikang Panturo from http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/mco/publications/2401/20071008.pdf\n\n[4] Pamilya Migrasyon Disintegrasyon by Fanny A.

I will have another post regarding my travel like expenses and places to visit. But this entry is intended for the application process.\n\nAs you would know, Japan Embassy in Philippines doesn\'t accept Tourist Visa applications via walk-in. You need an accredited agency to process the visa for you. In my case, I went to <a href=\"http://www.relitours.ph/\">Reli Tours </a>to process my visa for me. They have multiple branches in the metro but I opted to go to their <a href=\"http://www.relitours.ph/en-branch-dusit.html\">Dusit Thani Hotel branch </a>in Makati because it\'s near my office.\n\nThese are their numbers: 632-893-9226/ 0906-280-6666\n\nIn most of my calls with them, a Filipino-speaking Japanese operator will talk to you and help you with the process. I applied for a Tourist Visa w/o a Guarantee Letter. If you will apply for a Tourist Visa with Guarantee Letter, you will need to submit additional requirements and a different handling fee (a little more compared to the regular Tourist Visa).\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.ph.emb-japan.go.jp/visiting/new%20visa/tourism.htm\">requirements</a> are as follows per Japanese embassy which the agency will require: (Tourist Visa w/o guarantee letter)\n<ol>\n	<li>Philippine Passport\n<ul>\n	<li>It should be valid for more than 6 months before expiration from the time you leave and go back to the country.</li>\n	<li>The agency will warn but proceed processing your visa application even if you do not meet the above requirement. However, you might encounter problems with the Philippine immigration upon leaving the Philippines</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.ph.emb-japan.go.jp/visiting/consular_j/new%20visa/visa%20application%20form%202012.pdf\">Visa Application Form </a>\n<ul>\n	<li>The agency already has a copy for you to use.</li>\n	<li>You may also print it if you want.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n	<li>Photo\n<ul>\n	<li>2\'2 photo and must be pasted on the application form.</li>\n	<li>I submitted 1 copy with a white background.</li>\n	<li>Do not choose the Japan visa format picture advertised in some studios. That is not the required photo. Use 2\'2 photo only.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n	<li>Birth Certificate of Applicant\n<ul>\n	<li>Original copy from NSO</li>\n	<li>I applied for a <a href=\"https://www.ecensus.com.ph/Default.aspx\">birth certificate online</a>. It costs Php 315 and it will be delivered after 2-3 working days. You may pay in BDO branches.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n	<li>Daily Schedule\n<ul>\n	<li>There\'s a format for <a href=\"http://www.relitours.ph/application5-e-.pdf\">this</a>. I don\'t think you need to strictly follow everything you write here. But the embassy would like to know your activities during your stay in Japan.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n	<li>Bank Certificate\n<ul>\n	<li>There\'s no monetary requirement given by the embassy. I think the goal of the embassy is to check whether you have the capability to survive during your stay in Japan.</li>\n	<li>A bank certificate will range between Php 50-100 depending on you bank. You can do it over the counter in your account branch.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n	<li>ITR (Form 2316)\n<ul>\n	<li>I submitted a photocopy of the latest ITR document</li>\n	<li>Obviously, they want to know if you\'re employed and paying taxes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n	<li>Employment Certificate\n<ul>\n	<li>This will let the embassy know that you are employed and gives them assurance that you will come back after your vacation.</li>\n	<li>Ensure that your Employment Certificate indicates your role, start date and tenure, contact number of your HR, address of your company and salary.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\nActually, Japan tourist visa is free. I paid Php 1,200 for the processing/handling fee of the agency. It will take 5-7 working days before you can claim your passport and know whether your visa is approved on not.\n\nIn my case, they told me that they will call after 5 days if my passport is ready. But they didn\'t call so I did the initiative of calling them.\n\nI think when I got there and signed in their record book, all those who applied (around 20+) have successfully received a tourist visa. Since I explicitly said that I will be staying for 10 days, I was granted a tourist visa for 15 days with a validity of 3 months.\n\nSo, the news about Japan relaxing their visa requirements is really true. You just need to make sure that you have all your requirements with you. And everything will be fine!

The career exploration event intends to help them have a clear mind on what course to take, jobs awaiting them etc.\n\nFor my alma mater, Elizabeth Seton School-South (ESS) in Imus, Cavite, this career exploration is a week-long event. Various alumni of ESS give their talk and insights about college and career. Last July 2011, I was invited to give a talk about college life and real-world work experience in the industry.\n\nI was still employed in my first company, Perimeter E-Security (known as Silversky now) during that time. My presentation can be found here: <a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/career_talk_final.pdf\">Career Talk slides</a>.\n\nMy goal that day was to make students realize that choosing a course must be taken with a thorough analysis rather haphazardly. I realized that there are still many instances where it\'s the parents who decide for their children. For instance, my thesis mate who wanted to take Com Arts ended up taking Com Sci because his father wanted him to take a technical course. Otherwise, his dad won\'t allow him to go to college.\n\nOther students choose a particular school because of its prestige. A lot of students will limit their choices to the so-called \"Top Schools.\" Some other students will take a trending course like Nursing, for instance.\n\nI realized also that a good number of students still don\'t know which course to take and they end up choosing some course they are not really sure they want.\n\n<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/career_formula.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-210 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/career_formula.png?w=300\" alt=\"career_formula\" width=\"300\" height=\"160\" /></a>\n\nI emphasized 3 key important aspects when choosing a course:\n<ol>\n	<li>Desire -- So you are planning to take Nursing for example. Are you good in assisting and servicing other people? Or are you the type who is shy and a person who doesn\'t want to interact with people? Desire is important because it will be your motivation to fulfill your course. If you are into helping people as a profession, then Nursing can be for you.</li>\n	<li>Ability -- You want to take up Architecture. You really want to design and create patterns etc. You need to understand that you must have the \"hands\" for Architecture. You have to be keen, meticulous and detailed when doing your designs. In short, you need to have these minimum abilities in order for you to have a free-flowing journey in finishing your course.</li>\n	<li>Practicality -- So, you want to take Culinary Arts in college. You have the Desire and Ability to cook and experiment on creating your dishes. That\'s good. You\'re planning to go to College of St. Benilde (CSB) because it\'s known for their Culinary Arts program. However, your family cannot afford a 100,000php tuition and fees (excluding materials) per trimester to sustain your stay there. So what will you do? The best decision might be to look for another school that offers the course with a more affordable tuition and fees.</li>\n</ol>\nThe scenarios above are hypothetical. I believe that these components are very helpful in determining which course to take. These components have to be balanced.\n\nI do not fully agree that a student must limit himself/herself to Top Schools that they say, such as UP, Ateneo, La Salle and UST. There are a lot of schools out there that provide quality education as well. I won\'t agree that successful people only come from those \"top schools.\" I think that due to massive advertising and marketing, these schools are very much overrated.\n\nI\'ve met and made friends at work who are very smart and skilled who graduated from universities in the province. They are so down-to-earth but a subject matter expert (SME) in our field. So, although it\'s good to aim for schools in Manila, I can say that there are good schools found in other places in the Philippines.\n\nMy point is, it boils down to how the person develops himself/herself. The school may be a key, but the choice and decision to do best is up to the person.

Usually, it is included as an elective in a course or just a section in software development or network administration. But in these modern times, the study of Infosec encompasses various domains in IT and industries. Meaning to say, Infosec can be applied to database, business administration, human resource etc. It is important to understand that Infosec must be taken as a disparate discipline. Lastly, there are a lot of career opportunities that focus on Infosec because the field is taken as a separate entity. In the 90\'s for instance, Infosec is just part of the IT department. Now, there is a separate Security Operations team that manages just security related incidents.\n<h2>Infosec vs. IT Security</h2>\nThe question \"What is the difference between Infosec and IT Security?\" is usually queried in job interviews. Now, is there any distinction between the two terms? The answer can be based on the scope of the two. When we say IT Security, this talks about security solutions that are deployed to answer IT needs. For instance, IT Security can be deploying a firewall in the network to control acceptable packets that go in and out of the private network. Another IT Security solution can be deployment of Anti-virus (AV) software in end devices such as desktop computers and laptops.\n\nInfosec is bigger than just IT. IT Security is a subset of Infosec. A good example is, what type of door should I buy to securely lock the servers in the data center? Another example can be, what skills should the receptionist have in order to detect and counteract with fraud calls asking for confidential information?\n<h2>Formula of Security</h2>\nCan you imagine yourself going to SM Mall of Asia? Before you are allowed to get inside the mall, you will be subjected to so much inspection and frisking. I\'m just not sure if the guards know what they are looking for (pun intended). After the bag inspection and frisking, the queue of people getting in becomes longer and a lot are already angry.\n\nSame is true when you are going to inquire about your credit card balance over the phone. Before you are given the account balance, you will be subjected to various verification questions like date of birth, mother\'s maiden name, address and phone number.\n\nIsn\'t security a hassle? You may somehow have thought how to show the formula for security.\n\n<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/infosec_l1f1.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-213 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/infosec_l1f1.png?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"132\" /></a>\n\nSimply put, Security is inversely proportional to Convenience. This formula is applicable to all scenarios that will involve security. The more you enforce security, the more it is inconvenient to the users of the facility.\n<h2>Functionality-Usability-Security (FUS) Model</h2>\n<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/l1f2.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-214 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/l1f2.png?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" /></a>\n\nSupposed you are in your Software Development class or a freelance programmer doing a project for a client. The normal tendency of the programmer is to make sure that the requirements are met and that it is \"user-friendly\" with the user. In short, you need to please your client.\n\nIn security, it will teach you to lessen the attack surface of your application. Yes, you will have to meet the client requirements but you have to check if you can improve it in the security perspective. If you have written the program with 1,000 lines of code, can you improve it by lessening the lines of code? Hypothetically, if you can provide the same program with 100 lines of code with the same functionalities (or removing unnecessary functionalities), then your program is much better for security. There are less ways to exploit a program of 100 lines of code compare to 1,000.\n\nThe FUS Model simply states that if you focus solely on Usability, then there will be less Functionality and Security in your program. If you focus on Security on the other hand, there will be less Functionality and Usability in the program. The ideal scenario is to have balance between the three, as depicted in Figure 2.\n\nDepending on the program, however, the focus can change. If you are creating an online banking system for example, the program should be more on Security. In reality, the functionalities of online banking systems are very limited such as view account balance and transfer money from verified accounts at the very least. It is not user-friendly because you will be prompted to type a Transaction Password every time you do a transaction. All your activities are logged for auditing purposes.\n\n----- NOTHING FOLLOWS -----\n\nYou can download the PDF version of this lesson here: <a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/infosec_l1_introtoinfosec.pdf\">INFOSEC_L1_IntroToInfosec</a>.

I came with my colleagues, Ernesto Boydon and Noel Anonas from Asia Pacific College (APC) Makati City, Philippines.\n\nThe event was held in Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges in Nabua, Camarines Sur in the Bicol Region.\n\nThe key points of my talk are:\n\n1) Define ethical hacking (specifically to answer the question: Is there such thing as ethical hacking?)\n\n2) Information Security as a discipline. I included this as a key point because majority of the audience are either Computer Science or Information Technology undergraduates. I wanted them to know that Infosec exists and there are a lot of career opportunities for them in the said field.\n\n3) The need for cybercrime law. I obviously had to emphasize the need for a \"real\" cyber crime law that will protect the people especially their virtual assets.\n\nThe PDF version of my presentation can be downloaded here: <a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4th-bycit_jpineda.pdf\">4th BYCIT Presentation</a>\n\nI really enjoyed my stay in Nabua.

The participants were very active and the discussion was interactive.\n\nPhoto Credit: Eden Dungca\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_248\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1395923_900822596603236_4758897925518457254_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-248 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/1395923_900822596603236_4758897925518457254_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"1395923_900822596603236_4758897925518457254_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a> Lecture time.[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_249\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1920397_899287926756703_1185428698758128563_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-249 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/1920397_899287926756703_1185428698758128563_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"1920397_899287926756703_1185428698758128563_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a> After the 5-day workshop, they look fulfilled![/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_247\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/10665368_900822736603222_5103678021730335164_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-247 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/10665368_900822736603222_5103678021730335164_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10665368_900822736603222_5103678021730335164_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a> Remembering the OSI and the network devices.[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_244\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/10151769_900822626603233_479811379083320292_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-244 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/10151769_900822626603233_479811379083320292_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10151769_900822626603233_479811379083320292_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a> Lab exercise time[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_245\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/10300789_900822573269905_2495592550596721669_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-245 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/10300789_900822573269905_2495592550596721669_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10300789_900822573269905_2495592550596721669_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a> Light moments during the workshop[/caption]\n\n<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/10402587_900822679936561_332706450880114876_n.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-246 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/10402587_900822679936561_332706450880114876_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10402587_900822679936561_332706450880114876_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a> <a href=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/10003894_900822529936576_8764707224670948776_n.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-243 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/10003894_900822529936576_8764707224670948776_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10003894_900822529936576_8764707224670948776_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a>		',	'Ethical Hacking Workshop with SSS',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'ethical-hacking-workshop-with-sss',	'',	'',	'2014-12-21 17:19:47',	'2014-12-21 17:19:47',	'',	0,	'http://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=242',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

I was able to meet new people, learn new things and travel different places.\n\nHighlights:\n\n<strong>March 2014 - Went to Japan (Tokyo then to Osaka), then got engaged to the love of my life</strong>\n\nGoing to Japan was my dream since a child. On March 2014, my dream came true. I arrived at Narita Airport and fetched by my girlfriend. I stayed in her place in Shonandai. I also proposed to her and she said yes!\n\nI also experienced the transition from snow to the cherry blossom season. My travel was on the right timing.\n\nI also rode the shinkansen and met Ashley\'s family in Befu.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_256\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_0865.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-256\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_0865.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Near Lake Tanuki\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> Near Lake Tanuki[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_257\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_0901.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-257\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_0901.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"Snow remnants \" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> Snow remnants[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_258\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_1030.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-258\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_1030.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"Just happy together\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> Just happy together[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_259\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_1341.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-259\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_1341.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"Waiting for the Shinkansen to Osaka\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> Waiting for the Shinkansen to Osaka[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_260\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_1653.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-260\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_1653.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"With Ashley\'s dad and brother\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> With Ashley\'s dad and brother[/caption]\n\n<strong>April 2014 - My paper was published in Asia Pacific Chronicle</strong>\n\nThank you APC for supporting!\n\n<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1964909_763613600324137_1191120663_n.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-262 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/1964909_763613600324137_1191120663_n.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"1964909_763613600324137_1191120663_n\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n<strong>April 2014 - Baler Trip with APC colleagues and friends</strong>\n\nI was invited to join my very good and nice Atenean colleagues (haha, majority of them) from APC. They are actually from the School of Accountancy and Business (SOAB) but we became friends when my work cubicle was placed near them. We stayed in Bay\'s Inn. The food and beach were very awesome. We went to the Mother Falls, visited the Baler Museum, heard mass in their church and visited a very old tree in Aurora.\n\nI also attempted to do surfing. But I really need to lose weight before attempting another one. hehehe\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_268\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_1735.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-268\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_1735.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"Dawn at Baler, Aurora\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> Dawn at Baler, Aurora[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_267\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_1720.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-267\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_1720.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Breakfast time!!\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> Breakfast time!![/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_266\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_1884.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-266\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_1884.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"With that spooky old tree\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> With that spooky old tree[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_265\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_1864.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-265\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_1864.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Beside the bust of Manuel Quezon\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> Beside the bust of Manuel Quezon[/caption]\n\n<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_1826.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-264 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_1826.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"IMG_1826\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\n<strong>April 2014- Pagsanjan Trip with the family</strong>\n\nWe went to Pagsanjan for the Holy Week. We rode a small boat to go to Pagsanjan falls. There were so many Korean tourists there! Pagsanjan has a good LTE signal but the lodging places there are not so good.\n\nWe stayed in Lagos del Sol (the place was very peaceful and elegant). I recommend it for those who would like a serene and clean place.\n\nWe did some polo barong shopping in Lumban and slippers/shoe shopping in Liliw. We stopped in Los Banos to buy the original buko pie and cow\'s milk and chocolate drink. The traffic in Los Banos to Calamba, however, was stand still. (more family bonding time!)\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_270\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_2039.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-270 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2039.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"IMG_2039\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> Getting ready for some boating[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_271\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_2037.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-271\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2037.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"With Joseph and Nicole\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> With Joseph and Nicole[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_272\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_2021.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-272\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2021.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"It\'s the lake!\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> It\'s the lake![/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_273\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_2024.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-273\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2024.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Lagos del Sol grounds\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> Lagos del Sol grounds[/caption]\n\n<strong> May 2014- General Santos Trip with the family</strong>\n\nIt was my first time to go to Mindanao and I find it peaceful and progressive. I think the media is responsible for giving us a very negative impression of Mindanao.\n\nWe went to the famous KCC Mall of Gensan. We alo went to SM and Robinsons. The Pacman Gym is just across SM Gensan.\n\nWe went for a 2-hour drive to White Haven Beach Resort in Glan. We were at the bottom of the Philippines! The beach was very natural and the place was far from the city. It\'s not commercialized. It\'s a virgin place and a quiet one.\n\n<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_2256.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-275 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2256.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"IMG_2256\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_276\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_2182.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-276\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2182.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Gen Santos Airport\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> Gen Santos Airport[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_277\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_2184.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-277\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2184.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"It\'s Jinkee\'s store!\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> It\'s Jinkee\'s store at KCC Mall of Gensan[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_278\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_2185.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-278\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2185.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Happy 14th Birthday Joey Boy!\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> Happy 14th Birthday Joey Boy![/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_279\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_2198.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-279\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2198.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Tricycle ride to the beach\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> Tricycle ride to the beach[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_280\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_2208.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-280\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2208.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Beach at White Haven, Glan\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> Beach at White Haven, Glan[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_281\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/img_2210.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-281\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2210.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Beach at White Haven, Glan (That\'s the Celebes Sea.

The place looks very elegant but the beach is not good compared to the one in Glan. haha The White Haven beach resort set the standards. :)\n\nThere was plenty of food prepared by the company. We did some kayaking and used the swimming pool. There were plenty of Coke giveaways in the end.

In example 2, the student may have accidentally overwritten the teacher\'s file because of his negligence. He may also have overwritten the file intentionally out of revenge. But regardless of his intention, it is classified as a security issue.\n<h2>The Formula for Protection</h2>\nSome decades ago, the formula for protection is:\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1303\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/protection_old.png\" alt=\"PROTECTION_OLD\" width=\"559\" height=\"167\" /></p>\nThis means that in order to protect something, you need to prevent something bad from happening. For example, in order to prevent a home intruder from entering your home, you install a gate around your house. <em>You are preventing the intruder from getting in the house because of the gate.</em>\n\nSimilarly in the technical world, you can install a firewall in your network. A firewall is a hardware or software that enforces a security policy. For example, you have a web server in your company and you would like the public only to access the web server, the firewall can filter the traffic going to your network. Only packets/traffic that are destined to TCP port 80 (http) will be allowed to enter the network. That\'s because port 80 is specifically opened for web connections. All other traffic will be denied.\n\nNow, what is the problem or limitation with this formula?\n\nIn the first example (gate example), what will happen if the intruder climbs using a rope and he is able to pass the gate? Hypothetically, if the intruder is able to enter your house in the middle of the night, will you be able to stop him?\n\nThe formula for protection lacks other components.\n\nLet\'s say you bought a motion sensor alarm and a gun. You realize that if the intruder is able to enter your house after passing the gate using a rope, the motion sensor alarm will detect his movements and will alert you. Now if you see him and he\'s planning to attack you with some weapon, you can defend yourself by shooting him using your gun.\n\nWell, that\'s just a hypothetical situation. But the point is, you need to anticipate that your preventive tool may be bypassed. That\'s why you need to set up other security controls.\n\nTherefore, the modified and correct formula for protection is:\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1306\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/protection_new.png\" alt=\"PROTECTION_NEW\" width=\"999\" height=\"167\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Protection = Gate + (Motion Sensor Alarm + Shoot using your gun)</strong></p>\nThis formula can be applied to all domains of information security.\n\nGoing back to the firewall example, can you determine the limitation of implementing only a firewall in your network? If the firewall is the preventive tool, what is the detective tool and the response mechanism?\n<h2>Least Privilege</h2>\nI think the concept of least privilege is the essence of information security. In least privilege, you only get the privilege and access that you need, nothing more and nothing less.\n\nIn a company, there is an Accountant, HR assistant and Sales Agent. When we apply least privilege to these 3 employees, we will give each employees the following access to applications:\n\nAccountant - MS Excel, Calculator, E-mail, Printer\n\nHR Assistant - Telephone, Job Street, LinkedIn, MS Word, E-mail, Printer\n\nSales Agent - Telephone, Facebook, MS Word, E-mail, Printer\n\nIn least privilege, we list the things that each employee needs and we give the needed access to them. However, those applications that are not in the list won\'t be given to the users.\n<h3>Types of Least Privilege</h3>\n<h4>Separation of Duties (SOD)</h4>\nSOD states that a task (especially critical jobs) must be delegated to more than 1 person. Let’s use the payroll system as an example.\n\nHR Department – Computes your daily time record (DTR)\n\nAccounting Department – Computes your salary based of the DTR submitted by HR department\n\nManagement Group – Approves the salary computed and submitted by the Accounting department\n\nWhat happens if only one person, let’s say Paula, computes for the DTR and salary and approves the computation also?\n\nFor instance, if an employee, Gilbert, does not go to work, then it will reflect in his DTR. However, if Paula decides to give Gilbert a salary, then she can freely do so without anybody questioning it. There’s nobody who checks if the task is done correctly or not.\n\nThe SOD for the payroll scenario is very important to ensure checks and balances of activities related to work.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1304\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/sod.png\" alt=\"SOD\" width=\"589\" height=\"221\" />\n<h4>Implicit Deny</h4>\nImplicit Deny is another type of least privilege that is usually seen and applied in a firewall Access Control List (ACL). Assuming we have an entry in an access control list:\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1299\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/access-list.png\" alt=\"access-list\" width=\"479\" height=\"53\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">This ACL entry allows web traffic (tcp 80) going in and out of the network. If that’s the only rule that we have in the ACL, can we access the file server in the network (tcp 21)?</p>\nThe answer, of course, is no. But one can ask, will it deny tcp 21 even if there is not rule stating that it should be denied?\n\nThe implicit deny states that if there is no rule that states allow, then deny access. So even without a specific rule, it is understood that there is a <strong>“deny all” </strong>rule after the last entry in the ACL.\n\n<strong>Job Rotation</strong>\n\nJob Rotation is a not so known type of least privilege. This concept requires that other persons are familiar with the job that you have especially if it is a critical role. Although it is costly because you need to train other employees, this is very helpful in determining what is happening to the tasks assigned to a particular person.\n\nIf you are put in an employee’s shoes due to job rotation, you and the management may find a lot of things. For example, why does this employee take 10 hours (with overtime) to do his job when I can finish it in 4 hours when I assumed his role in job rotation? There may be something to investigate in this issue.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1302\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/job-rotation.png\" alt=\"Job Rotation\" width=\"854\" height=\"574\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">----- NOTHING FOLLOWS -----</p>\n&nbsp;		',	'Lesson 2: Security CIA, Protection & Least Privilege Concepts',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'lesson-2-cia-triad-formula-for-protection-least-privilege',	'',	'',	'2015-01-27 10:34:24',	'2015-01-27 10:34:24',	'',	0,	'https://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=341',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

And as we have discussed in Lesson 1, the scope of Infosec is very broad and IT Security is just part of it. We have also learned in Lesson 2 that preventive controls are incomplete without detective controls and response. With former concepts discussed, a more concrete and concise security architecture is formed- Defense in Depth.\n\nThe concept of Defense in Depth states that in order for anybody to access the data, it should pass layers of security first. Security controls may vary but it should be in layers.\n\nFor example, if you want to access the bank database, you need to pass through frisking of security guards, inspection of bags and proper identification when entering the bank premises. That is what we call Physical Security.\n\nWhen you enter the premises, you are required to wear your ID at all times. If you are a visitor, a security personnel is required to accompany you wherever you go within the premises. That is the next layer called the Operational Security.\n\nIf you connect to their wireless network and your laptop cannot access the Internet because of MAC filtering, that is an example of Network Security.\n\nWhen desktop computers have disabled USB ports to prevent spread/download of virus, that is an example of Host Security.\n\nWhen you need to enter a username and password to gain access to your account, that is an example of Application Security.\n<h2>Diversity of Defense</h2>\nThe Diversity of Defense security concept is quite tricky. Management will always want a cost-effective IT infrastructure setup. For example, Huawei, a known networking product, might offer an IT infrastructure package that may be very appealing. Let’s say they offer the whole IT infrastructure with X pesos. The management may be lured to buy the package because of the cost. However, as an information security professional, you should weigh the possible security issues that may take in place.\n\nIn Diversity of Defense, you are compelled to buy different brands of network and IT devices such as firewall, switch, router, etc. But assuming you plan to buy different types of devices, the cost may double (2X pesos) compared to the X pesos if you have a single brand.\n\nSo what is the advantage of this concept?\n\nIf a vulnerability in Huawei firewall is found, no matter how many Huawei firewalls you have, then your network is vulnerable to that particular attack. You can simply say that the cost of information disclosure is way more expensive than the implementation of diversity of defense when a single proprietary vulnerability is exploited.\n<h2>Security through Obscurity</h2>\nIf we say that a company is implementing security through obscurity, can we consider it secured? In Security through Obscurity, we rely on the idea that nobody will think that some valuable asset is hidden in an obscure place.\n\nFor example, will anybody think that there’s 1M pesos stored underneath the driver’s seat of my car? What are the odds, right? But if I accidentally left my car unlock and somebody randomly opens the door of my car, is my asset still secured?\n\nSecurity through obscurity is simply hiding something. But hiding something without proper safeguards has no security at all.\n<h2>Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)</h2>\nIn information security terms, CBA refers to the weighing of the cost of safeguards to the value of asset. As a rule of thumb, you are not supposed to buy a safeguard that is more expensive than the asset.\n\nFor example, you won’t buy a vault that is valued at 20,000 pesos to safeguard a Timex watch from a buy 1 take 1 sale worth 2,000 pesos. The thief will probably steal the safeguard instead of the asset in it.\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">----- NOTHING FOLLOWS -----</p>\nYou can download the PDF version of this lesson here: <a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/infosec_l3_gensec.pdf\">INFOSEC_L3_GenSec</a>		',	'Lesson 3: Defense in Depth and related concepts',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'lesson-3-defense-in-depth-and-related-concepts',	'',	'',	'2015-01-27 14:19:48',	'2015-01-27 14:19:48',	'',	0,	'https://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=345',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

By default, we have 3 types of authentication:\n<ol>\n	<li>Something that you know – A form of authentication coming from what you know (residing in the mind)</li>\n</ol>\nEx. Password, pin\n<ol start=\"2\">\n	<li>Something that you have – A form of authentication that is tangible.</li>\n</ol>\nEx. Token, cellphone, ID\n<ol start=\"3\">\n	<li>Something that you are – A form of authentication where the uniqueness of the part of your body is used.</li>\n</ol>\nEx. Fingerprint, voice recognition, iris scan\n\nNot one of the authentication types can be considered the strongest. <em>Something that you know</em> authentication such as password can be cracked using brute force or social engineering. <em>Something that you have authentication</em> such as ID’s can be stolen or reproduced. <em>Something that you are</em> authentication such fingerprint is prone to false positives (you have sweaty hands etc.)\n\nTo make your authentication stronger, it is advised that you use 2 or more types of authentication to provide a layer of security. This is what we call 2-factor or multi-factor authentication. Examples include:\n<ol>\n	<li>ATM + Pin (something that you have and you know)</li>\n	<li>Credit card + signature (something that you have and you know)</li>\n	<li>Cellphone for One-Time Password (OTP) + password (something that you have and you know)</li>\n	<li>Badge + biometric (something that you have and you are)</li>\n</ol>\nNote: Usernames and passwords are not considered multi-factor because both are something that you know type of authentication.\n\nQuestions to search on:\n<ol>\n	<li>What is the fourth type (or other types) of authentication?</li>\n	<li>What is the most accurate biometric? Why?</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Types of Access Control</h2>\nAccess Control or Authorization determines the type of privilege a user has after being authenticated. If you enter the school, an authentication mechanism could be your school ID. Access Control determines which rooms in the school you can access. If you’re a student, you can access the classrooms, computer laboratories and cafeteria. However, you are prohibited from accessing the faculty room and server room. A faculty member can access more rooms compared to a student.\n<h3>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</h3>\nMAC is the strictest type of access control. This access control can be seen in government especially in military. It uses Sensitivity Labels (SL) both for the subject (initiates an action) and object (waiting for action). It is also known as a multi-level type of access control.\n\nSL can be classified as:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"638\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Top Secret</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Secret</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Confidential</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Public</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nLet’s say a File A (Object) has an SL of Secret. Only the subject that has an SL of either Top Secret or Secret can access the file.\n\nTo visualize, let’s say a 5-star General has an SL of Top Secret, Colonel with SL of Secret, Lieutenant with SL of Confidential and Sergeant with SL of Public. Only the Colonel or 5-Star General can access File A because they have clearance to do so because of their SL. A subject can access all objects that are below his/her SL. MAC uses a top-down approach.\n<h3>Discretionary Access Control (DAC)</h3>\nDAC is the direct opposite of MAC. In this case, this type of access control can be seen in non-military institutions (commercial use, usually). In DAC, the owner of the file determines the privilege of the subjects to the objects. It is also known as a single-level type of access control.\n\nDAC uses an Access Control Matrix (r-read, w-write, x-execute) shown below:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"160\"><strong>S (down) O (right)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"160\"><strong>Chicken File</strong>\n\n<strong>Owner: Riza</strong>\n\n<strong>Object 1</strong></td>\n<td width=\"160\"><strong>Pasta File</strong>\n\n<strong>Owner: Reese</strong>\n\n<strong>Object 2</strong></td>\n<td width=\"160\"><strong>Beef File</strong>\n\n<strong>Owner: Rex</strong>\n\n<strong>Object 3</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"160\"><strong>James</strong>\n\n<strong>Subject 1</strong></td>\n<td width=\"160\">rwx</td>\n<td width=\"160\">---</td>\n<td width=\"160\">-wx</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"160\"><strong>Ray</strong>\n\n<strong>Subject 2</strong></td>\n<td width=\"160\">rw-</td>\n<td width=\"160\">rw-</td>\n<td width=\"160\">-wx</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"160\"><strong>Ogawa</strong>\n\n<strong>Subject 3</strong></td>\n<td width=\"160\">---</td>\n<td width=\"160\">rwx</td>\n<td width=\"160\">-wx</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nIn the above scenario, we have 3 users (subjects) trying to access 3 files (objects). Each file is owned by a specific individual (owner). It becomes the discretion of the owner on what privileges he/she wants to give the subjects. These privileges may change also.\n<h3>Role-based Access Control (RBAC)</h3>\nRBAC is also known as a non-discretionary access control. It gives privileges based on the roles/tasks. It is beneficial for large organizations in organizing group privileges to objects. For example, all students have read only access to File 1, File 2 and File 3. All faculty members, on the other hand, have full access to all the files mentioned. The admin will just add users (subjects) on the groups created for consistency and convenience.\n<h3>Rule-based Access Control</h3>\nRule-based Access Control basically gives privilege based on a list of an enforced policy. A good example is an Access Control List (ACL) in a firewall. The firewall will grant/deny access based on the rules found in the ACL. However, if no rule is present, then no privilege should be given. (implicit deny)\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">----- NOTHING FOLLOWS -----</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">You can download the PDF version of this lesson here: <a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/infosec_l4_authac.pdf\">INFOSEC_L4_AuthAC</a></p>		',	'Lesson 4: Types of Authentication and Access Control',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'lesson-4-types-of-authentication-and-access-control',	'',	'',	'2015-02-04 09:48:50',	'2015-02-04 09:48:50',	'',	0,	'https://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=349',	0,	'post',	'',	0),
(352,	1,	'2015-02-05 11:48:45',	'2015-02-05 11:48:45',	'\n				When I studied and took EC-Council’s Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) in 2013, I learned a very important lesson: even if you follow the hacking methodologies, it only has a 10% success rate. This lesson has, on the other hand, 90% success rate. In gist: Why would you spend a lot of time to brute force a password when you can just ask for it? That’s social engineering.\n\nSocial Engineering is an attempt to gain information from a victim or target through manipulation and deceit. The attacker attempts to gain the victim’s trust then exploits the emotions of the latter.\n\nNote: There is a reading I wrote in 2011 that is relevant with this lesson. Copies will be/are given during class.\n<h2>Why is Social Engineering very successful?</h2>\nIn the past lessons, we studied about Defense in Depth. This means that in every layer of security, there should be protection. Now in Network Security for instance, you may deploy and implement a firewall. The firewall has its limitations but it will strictly enforce whatever rules are written in the ACL. If it says allow web traffic, it will allow web traffic. If it says deny FTP traffic then it will deny FTP traffic.\n\nProblems rise when humans intervene. Let’s say a school enforces a “No ID, No Entry” policy. All students are required to wear their ID upon entering the school. One day, one student forgot to bring his ID but the guard still allowed him to enter because they’re friends. Is it correct for a guard to make exceptions even if there’s an explicit ID policy? What if the said student brought his friends? Will the guard still allow it because they’re friends?\n\nHumans or wetware are the weakest link in the security chain because they simply make a lot of exceptions. That’s why the human vulnerability is a weakness that no patch can perfectly fix.\n<h2>Ethics: Social Engineering in Penetration Testing</h2>\nIn penetration testing, a third party service provider actively tests the security solutions implemented in the network. Active testing means exploiting discovered weaknesses in security. One of the tests is the social engineering test. In this case, the pen tester tries to bypass security through social engineering.\n\nFor example, the company security policy requires the use of a badge/ID to enter the office. The pen tester will carry a lot of heavy things so the guard will help him instead of looking for the ID. The pen tester successfully enters the facility with the guard as accessory to the crime. After the pen testing, the guard is terminated due to abandonment of duty during the test.\n\nIt is the job of the pen tester to lure people into breaking the policy. The targets, out of good-will, will help them. But in the end, they will be terminated. Is that ethical?\n<h2>Steps in Social Engineering</h2>\nThere are three steps in social engineering.\n<ol>\n	<li>Information Gathering</li>\n</ol>\nIn this step, the social engineer gathers as many information about his target as possible. He can do online searches in social networking sites, stalk the target to learn his routines and talk to his friends to learn more about his likes.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n	<li>Developing Relationships</li>\n</ol>\nAfter you have gathered enough information about your target, it’s time to build relationship. Let’s say you learned that the target likes Justin Bieber. You can create a “perfect encounter” with him in his daily routine. You could probably sit beside him in a bus and have a little chitchat about Justin Bieber. Ideally, you can build a relationship with the “serendipitous meeting.” In some cases, you will need to “invest” on something. If you learned that the target is in a lot of debt, aside from being a Justin Bieber fan, you can use that to your advantage for the next step.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n	<li>Exploitation</li>\n</ol>\nIn the last step, you push through with your goal of eliciting the information you need from the target. You may have allowed your target to borrow a sum of money from you so that he can pay his debt. Now, you can use that to your advantage. You can ask for the information and remind him that he is in debt so he should return the favor. In this case, you are successful in your mission.\n<h2>Types of Social Engineering Attacks</h2>\nThe Social Engineering Attacks can be classified into 2 categories:\n<ol>\n	<li>Non-technical – Doing social engineering in a traditional way\n<ol>\n	<li>Dumpster diving – Literally checking the target’s garbage.</li>\n	<li>Shoulder surfing – Glancing at other person’s computer, cellphone or paper.</li>\n	<li>Impersonation – Pretending to be key personnel in your target’s company.</li>\n	<li>Tailgating – Walking in the vicinity after the person ahead of you taps his badge to open the access door.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n	<li>Technical – Doing social engineering using technology\n<ol>\n	<li>Phishing – Getting target’s information using fake e-mail or website.</li>\n	<li>Spear phishing – A type of phishing targeting a particular person.</li>\n	<li>Pharming – A type of phishing targeting a group of people/organization.</li>\n	<li>Vishing – Deceiving target using telephone/cellphone/smart phone.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">----- NOTHING FOLLOWS -----</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">You can download the PDF version of this lesson here: <a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/infosec_l5_se.pdf\">INFOSEC_L5_SE</a></p>		',	'Lesson 5: Social Engineering',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'lesson-5-social-engineering',	'',	'',	'2015-02-05 11:48:45',	'2015-02-05 11:48:45',	'',	0,	'https://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=352',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

It\'s a 2-hour drive from Quezon City to Batangas City with more than 100 kilometers from my place to the venue.\n\nWhat I like about Batangas City is that it\'s very clean and people are very orderly. The place didn\'t look much of a province at all! It looks very progressive.\n\nI was supposed to focus on Ethical Hacking. However, I learned that the theme was \"CCS: Practicing Theories towards ASEAN Integration.\" I introduced Information Security as a discipline and introduced career opportunities to students especially for those graduating ones.\n\nPhoto credit to the student photographer of LPU-Batangas.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_360\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/10979311_10205887674729896_81024097_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-360 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/10979311_10205887674729896_81024097_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10979311_10205887674729896_81024097_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a> With the Department Chairs, Tina &amp; Mischelle (from left), and Dean Roselie Alday,[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_361\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/10965875_10205887683850124_2030415691_n1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-361 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/10965875_10205887683850124_2030415691_n1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10965875_10205887683850124_2030415691_n(1)\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a> With Ernesto Boydon, my colleague in APC and the second speaker.[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_362\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/10966857_10205887683810123_199112349_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-362 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/10966857_10205887683810123_199112349_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10966857_10205887683810123_199112349_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a> With Irene Balmes, my former colleague in APC[/caption]\n\n<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/10965543_10205887667929726_1758397814_n.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-356 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/10965543_10205887667929726_1758397814_n.jpg?w=200\" alt=\"10965543_10205887667929726_1758397814_n\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/10965927_10205887668009728_1338855883_n.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-357 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/10965927_10205887668009728_1338855883_n.jpg?w=200\" alt=\"10965927_10205887668009728_1338855883_n\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/10965467_10205887666449689_936184996_n.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-363 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/10965467_10205887666449689_936184996_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10965467_10205887666449689_936184996_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/10966514_10205887667329711_802150987_n.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-365 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/10966514_10205887667329711_802150987_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10966514_10205887667329711_802150987_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/10961925_10205887667649719_1207230235_n.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-366 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/10961925_10205887667649719_1207230235_n.jpg?w=200\" alt=\"10961925_10205887667649719_1207230235_n\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a>You may download the slides of my presentation here: <a href=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/information-security-discipline-opportunities.pdf\">Information Security Discipline Opportunities</a>		',	'Infosec: Discipline and Opportunities at LPU Batangas',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'infosec-discipline-and-opportunities-at-lpu-batangas',	'',	'',	'2015-02-05 12:50:53',	'2015-02-05 12:50:53',	'',	0,	'https://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=355',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

It\'s my first time to go there and to that part of Pasig City.\n\nI was very fascinated by the campus because the classrooms and facilities are state-of-the-art. Also, the CCS students were very hospitable and accommodating during my stay.\n\nMy talk was about protecting your network through Network Security and discussed some types attacks and countermeasure. I started the talk with the latest security news on <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/news/lenovos-superfish-screwup-highlights-biggest-problem-in-software/\">Superfish </a>which affected Lenovo products. I also encouraged the school to participate with <a href=\"http://jissaph.org/\">JISSA (Junior Information Security Systems Association)</a> which can help the schools learn the IT trends in information security.\n\nYou can download my presentation here: <a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/protection-through-network-security.pdf\">Protection through Network Security </a>\n\nPhoto credit to: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/boiboi.ladera?pnref=story\">Jhes Ter Ladera</a>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_371\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/11035627_10204873574950491_6813368003208916790_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-371 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/11035627_10204873574950491_6813368003208916790_o.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"11035627_10204873574950491_6813368003208916790_o\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a> I really am happy! haha[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_373\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1655474_10204873564030218_4356033935283196982_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-373 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/1655474_10204873564030218_4356033935283196982_o.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"1655474_10204873564030218_4356033935283196982_o\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a> Discussing Defense-in-Depth (layers of security)[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_375\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/10708700_10204873582350676_2446237824854056741_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-375 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/10708700_10204873582350676_2446237824854056741_o.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10708700_10204873582350676_2446237824854056741_o\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a> w/ the 3rd year student organizers of the program[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_376\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/10861019_10204873579430603_817000487512266403_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-376 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/10861019_10204873579430603_817000487512266403_o.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10861019_10204873579430603_817000487512266403_o\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a> Thanks for the caricature!

The paper was a product of a project in <a href=\"https://www.apc.edu.ph/\">APC </a>together with my students in INFOSEC. The trip was entirely sponsored by the school (thank you so much!) and the experience was very unforgettable.\n\n<strong>Going to Kuala Lumpur</strong>\n\nI rode a Cebu Pacific plane going to Malaysia last Jun 7 in NAIA Terminal 3. As usual, the airport was jampacked with people. The flight was around 4 hours long and arrived at the KLIA2. I then rode an express train (20-minute train) going to the downtown KL.\n\nI met my former officemate in the Philippines who is already working in KL. He toured me around KL (Petronas, Jalon Alor) and brought me to the hotel, <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298570-d302628-Reviews-Melia_Kuala_Lumpur-Kuala_Lumpur_Wilayah_Persekutuan.html\">Melia Hote</a>l.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_387\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1381942_1001804846505010_5715889195211344600_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-387 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/1381942_1001804846505010_5715889195211344600_n.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"1381942_1001804846505010_5715889195211344600_n\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> With Ashley Dy in front of the Petronas Towers (thanks Alfred for the picture)[/caption]\n\n<strong>Conference Day</strong>\n\nIt\'s a good thing that the school booked in the hotel where the conference will be held. The parallel sessions started at 8am. It was my first time to present in an international conference and I was very nervous. The presenters were mostly Muslims coming from Malaysia, Indonesia, India other neighboring countries. The participants were very friendly and excited too.

In essence, Dr. Idrus pointed out that teachers and the curriculum must be able to adapt with the technological advances in today\'s world.\n\nMy presentation was scheduled in the afternoon. The paper is an applied research on how to detect Botnet traffic in a Local Area Network (LAN) using Snort and aggregated reputable Botnet sources.\n\nThe presentation lasted for 10 minutes.

We checked out then rode Uber to the train station going to KLIA2.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_390\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"169\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/11400979_1002590966426398_6977224417622689267_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-390\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/11400979_1002590966426398_6977224417622689267_n.jpg?w=169\" alt=\"Uber ride to Ritz Carlton\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\" /></a> Uber ride to Ritz Carlton[/caption]\n\n<strong> Over-all experience</strong>\n\nI heard a lot of negative stories in Malaysia (dangerous at night, a lot of street clubs, ill-mannered taxi drivers, snatchers riding motorcycles etc.) but I haven\'t experienced those stories.

(396,	1,	'2015-07-07 09:31:55',	'2015-07-07 09:31:55',	'\n				It’s been five weeks since I have started with my classes in Master’s. I’ve been bombarded with a lot of new topics which I find very interesting. I have to admit that I’m very new with management courses (which is the majority composition of the degree) coming from a technical course such as Computer Science. However, I really think that it is very helpful and important to evolve learning the correct way of managing IT. I know I have a long way to go with this but I’m enjoying it especially with the case study discussions with Mr. Fiel Javier, the professor.\n<h1>Meeting 1: June 6, 2015</h1>\nWe were around 16-17 in class, mostly working in the industry. When Sir Fiel arrived, our sleepiness (the class is scheduled after lunch in a cold room) suddenly disappeared because of his authoritative and loud voice. He is quite intimidating and scary at first. We did some introduction and he proceeded with the distribution of the syllabus.\n\nOne thing I learned during that day was not relying only in the “best practices.” Sir Fiel emphasized that <strong>best practices must be thought of as the minimum standard</strong>. Organizations must strive better than the best practices. If you can make the process much better than what the best practice requires, then it should be done.\n\nI think Sir Fiel made a good point. Best practices is not excellence. It is just the minimum baseline. Organizations must strive to be above the best practice.\n\nAt the end of the class, Sir Fiel reminded us to read the readings and cases he will be sending via e-mail.\n<h1>Meeting 2: June 13, 2015</h1>\nWe discussed the meaning of business during the start if the class. Sir Fiel asked what the meaning of business is. However, none of us was able to give a complete definition of the term business. One key take away I learned is that even non-profit organizations need to have a profit to survive. Then I learned the “correct” definition of business: <strong>Business is a gainful activity to service the society where profit is a necessity and loss is a possibility. </strong>\n\nWe were also asked to differentiate Information Technology (IT) and Information System (IS). I learned that IT is just a subset of IS.\n\nSir Fiel reminded us to read the readings before analyzing the case studies<strong>. He pointed out to identify the problem correctly because it already solves 50% of the task. </strong>\n\nBefore the end of the class, Sir Fiel mentioned about the usefulness of technology. He said that “Technology may be advanced but not necessarily society is ready for it.”\n<h1>Meeting 3: June 20, 2015</h1>\nAfter a long group meeting on June 18, we were able to come up with our Case Study solution for Electric Power PLC. Unfortunately, our answers were wrong after we have shared it in class. We were asked in class the difference between a strategy and policy.\n\nNobody got the perfect definition. We were then told that <strong>strategy is the objective to achieve the goal. It is the over-arching plan of an organization. The policy on the other hand, tells how to do the strategy.</strong> Therefore, policy supports the strategy. Sir Fiel stressed that strategy is about positioning, likening it to the Spartans in 300. They knew they were going to die, but positioned themselves strategically to be able to fight their opponents well.\n\nOne good example given was: Why do we need to ask permission 3 days in advance when filing a Vacation Leave? If you will ask the HR, they will say that it’s the policy and we must follow it. But looking at the Strategic Level (long-term), the company might have a strategy, “Produce X amount within Y days.” That’s why the policy regarding filing of VL was implemented in the operational level.\n\nOn analyzing the case study, we were reminded to follow the SMART objective – Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound.\n<h1>Meeting 4: June 27, 2015</h1>\nWe finished the second case study, Vicro Communications, having declining revenues and not flexible ERP software. It’s funny because we were able to come up with the objective and the problem but lacking substantial information in the case analysis.\n\nSir Fiel taught us to use the tools in the readings to clearly understand the case and give a proper analysis. For example, we used the System Strategizing model to determine whether the company is Prospective, Proactive, Reactive or Isolated. Some other assessment tools were used.\n\nOne important lesson I learned in the Vicro case is Business Process Reengineering. <strong>I learned that a radical redesign can cause abrupt destruction of the business. </strong>\n\nIn the latter part of the class, we were asked for the definition of architecture. Nobody can give a straight answer to the question. There was laughing moment when Sir Fiel said that we’ve been using terms we don’t know how to define. But in the end, <strong>architecture was simply defined as an organization of interrelated parts.</strong>\n\nWe briefly discussed the Enterprise IT Architecture such as Zachman and TOGAF.\n<h1>Meeting 5: July 4, 2015</h1>\nI thought that the meeting will be a light moment because we were tasked to do an individual exercise. It took us 3 hours to finish assessing our company based on the tools given such as: IS Strategy Development Phase, IS Strategy Approach, Value of Information to Firm, IS Growth Model (Nolan’s Stages of Growth Model), SISP Approach, Strategic Alignment Model Assessment, IT Architecture Stage Assessment, IT Organizational Model Assessment and IT Value-Creating Processes Assessment.\n\nIt was a very tiresome session indeed!

(399,	1,	'2015-07-07 11:53:34',	'2015-07-07 11:53:34',	'\n				<h1>Meeting 1: Understanding Organization in the New Economy</h1>\n<h2>Date: June 6, 2015</h2>\nMy first class in my MIS was Organization, Management and Administration of Information Systems. The class was led by our professor, Mr. Jerald De La Rosa.\n\nWe did some introduction with one another and set expectations and explained the house rules. Sir Je called the syllabus as a “Learning Contract” which both of us should agree on.\n\nA very good reminder coming from him was to empty our minds so that new things can enter. If we do not empty our minds and act like experts, new ideas might not come in.\n\nFor the discussion, we learned the management functions (planning, organizing, leading and controlling), the functional areas of the organization (marketing, production, sales, admin and finance), levels of organization (strategic, tactical and operational) and the emerging organization (traditional vs. emerging view).\n\nOne student asked where IT is in the functional areas of the organization. It’s said that IT is incorporated in all functional areas of the organization.\n\nWe also discussed the management competency matrix where the technical or low-level has more operational and organizational competencies than interpersonal competencies. On the other hand, top management has more interpersonal competencies than operational competencies.\n\nSome people can directly go to top management without experience low-level. However, those coming from low-level have a good experience to lead when they reach the top-level management.\n\nIn the end, we were asked to form in groups and discuss our stand in some organization and management issues in the new economy. We need to agree as a group if the statement is Always True, Mostly True, Mostly False or Always False.\n\nSome of the issues are:\n<ol>\n	<li>Vision/Mission statement is a paradox to new economy.</li>\n	<li>“Customer is King” is a paradox to new economy.</li>\n	<li>Cross functional team are effective and represent a good form of organizational structure.</li>\n	<li>Workers are more interested in remuneration than challenging function.</li>\n	<li>Management should discourage informal group of workers in an organization.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Meeting 2: Self-Assessment Exercise Discussion</h1>\n<h2>Date: June 13, 2015</h2>\nSir Je was not around during this day but he asked us to discuss the self-assessment exercise among ourselves and prepare to defend our stand in the next meeting.\n\nHere are the items assigned for me to research on and my answers:\n<ol>\n	<li>“Customer is King” is a paradox to new economy. – <strong>MOSTLY FALSE</strong>\n<ul>\n	<li>Tim Rosenbrook sums up 5 reasons why the motto \"Customer is King\" is very applicable even in the new economy.</li>\n	<li>A customer\'s perception is their reality. - The customer is not always right per se but the customer is the key to your business\' success. Therefore, their perception is their reality.</li>\n	<li>It’s easier to keep your customers happy than attract new ones. This is pretty much straightforward and applicable to any type of business. You need to take care of your current customers so they will stay.</li>\n	<li>Complaints spread like wildfire on the Internet. This is very applicable most especially in the new economy, in this Internet Age.</li>\n	<li>Without customers we don’t have a business. This is the root of the motto \"Customer is King\"   and very much similar to reason # 1.</li>\n	<li>Brands win or lose by how well they WOW customer. Most of the time, the brand is judged on how the customer service is implemented. Would you even care to eat in a fine dining restaurant with great food but bad service?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n	<li>Organization could careless in understanding business complexities and processes than developing technology innovation and strategy. – <strong>ALWAYS FALSE</strong>\n<ul>\n	<li>According to Syncronet, an IT Support Service company, technology is a wonderful thing but its acquisition needs to have clear objectives such as SMART goals, measureable ROI etc. That\'s why the organization must give equal care and attention both to business complexities and technology. Business complexities and processes help organizations determine which technologies are needed and cost effective. Technology, on the other hand, eases processes. Balancing the two will yield to expected results.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n	<li>IT Leaders should have a voice at the executive table at which key business decisions are made. <strong>- ALWAYS TRUE</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n	<li>IT Leaders, should be able to have a voice in the executive table like the role of a Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security Office (CISO), Chief Technology Office (CTO) etc. According to Charles Araujo, one of the new roles of an IT Leader is being a negotiator and mediator. The leader must be able to determine the stand of the organization based on its policies and objectives and implement technological outcomes based on it.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n	<li>IT Leaders should focus on technological innovation than delivery of business outcomes through IT Services. - <strong>MOSTLY FALSE</strong>\n<ul>\n	<li>IT Leaders are managers in their primary role. This means they are not solely technical. Therefore, they need technological innovation that can deliver business outcomes. According to Charles Araujo, another role of the IT Leader is a Business Process Innovator. It is the most challenging yet most important of all. It is the role of the IT leaders to create business process innovation on emerging technologies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Meeting 3: The New Wealth of Organization</h1>\n<h2>Date: June 20, 2015</h2>\nDuring this meeting, we started with Part 1 of the self-assessment exercise. Our group was scolded because we were not able to print the report. We were able to compare notes with the presenting group during the discussion.\n\nIn the discussion, we started with the historical era of economy such as the agricultural, industrial and knowledge era. We were able to learn the “new economy” with indicators such as industrial and occupational change, globalization, dynamism and competition and the IT revolution.\n\nOne new and interesting term I learned during that meeting is the term “coopetition” or collaboration among competitors.\n\nI also learned the intangible assets (intellectual capital). The tangible assets (physical capital) are known everywhere already. I learned that the sources of intellectual capital are: human capital, structural capital and customer capital. The combination of these sources yields to organizational wealth.\n\nAt the end of the class, we were given a homework. We were tasked to determine the intellectual capital of our own organization.\n<h1>Meeting 4: Customer Satisfaction in the Product and Service Delivery Process</h1>\n<h2>Date: June 27, 2015</h2>\nWe continued Part 2 of the Self-Assessment Exercise. In this meeting, our group was the one that presented. Our presentation can be found here: <a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/week-3-self-assessment-exercise.pdf\">Week 3 - Self-assessment exercise</a>.\n\nThe discussion focused on customer satisfaction. One thing I learned in this meeting is that the “Customer is the most important person in this place” and that “A customer does not depend on us, we depend on him.” This is an excerpt from EFQM.org\n\nAnother thing that struck me is the customer lifecycle. There are five stages in this cycle: Unqualified Customer – (market) -&gt; Prospective Customer – (sell) -&gt; Customer – (fulfill) -&gt; Satisfied Customer – (care) -&gt; Repeat Customer.\n\nI think some organizations forget to “care” for the customers so they will become “Repeat Customers.”\n\nAt the end of the class, we were given some case studies to analyze. We also chose the topics for our individual reporting.\n<h1>Meeting 5: People in the New Organization Paradigm</h1>\n<h2>Date: July 4, 2015</h2>\nI arrived late for class after some tiring activities on Friday. We finalized the schedule for our group and individual presentation. We were reminded that the individual presentation is expected to be a board room discussion. We need to convince the board to implement what we are proposing.\n\nSome points I learned that day:\n\nIn an organization, there is a core service and a support service. Way back, IT is considered a support service or a cost center. Nowadays, IT is part of the core service of the organization.\n\nValue chain consists both the primary and support services.\n\nCompetitive advantage is very important in an organization’s success. Differentiation helps an organization gain competitive advantage. For example, Google started affordable wearable technology. That plan gives them competitive advantage.\n\nWe also learned different organizational structure which helps determining the hierarchy in decision making process and scope and accountabilities.\n\nFor the culminating activity, our group chose a data center and we defined the core and support services as well as the organizational chart based on value chain.

(403,	1,	'2015-07-10 05:02:50',	'2015-07-10 05:02:50',	'\n				SINCE I moved in Quezon City (QC), I became more knowledgeable on the road. I learned more shortcuts and long cuts going to work in BGC (Taguig City) and Magallanes Village (Makati City). Aside from the very busy EDSA, I learned the streets of Cubao District such as V. Luna, 15th/20th ave., Boni Serrano, Whiteplains and C-5 road. I also learned the streets of Pasig such Greenmeadows, Lanuza, Capt. P. Javier, St. Martin and Canley (where motels are found). Lastly, I learned the streets of New Manila such as the end of Sct Ybardolaza, Dona Hemady, Betty Go, Mariposa and N. Domingo. It\'s a very good experience learning those routes.\n\nOn a more important note, living in QC taught me to be more mature and patient on the road. Everyday, I hear news of road rage, from shouting to killing each other just because of not giving way for sharp-swerving vehicles. I subscribed to T<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/topgearphilippines?fref=ts\">opGear PH page</a> and I see these horrific news on road rage and accidents everyday.\n\nOne initiative made by PNoy was to remove the \"wang-wang\" culture. VIP\'s use their sirens so vehicles will give way to them, although they are cursing the VIP\'s for using their power. Now, only ambulance and fire trucks can use sirens. However, this ugly practice is still experienced today without the \"wang-wang.\" I have experienced this twice when there was a VIP convoy (2 vehicles) in EDSA. They came from Ayala to EDSA flyover. There was a wide distance between them and I switched to their lane. Then, I was in between the 2 vehicles without knowing that they\'re in convoy. And then the vehicle behind me (bodyguards) started blowing the horn continuously and started aggressively overtaking my car to the point where I almost hit other vehicles in the other lane. Good thing the hot-tempered me stage already passed. But what will happen if these egoistic VIP\'s encountered another of their kind? The sad thing is, even if you try to avoid these scenarios, they will try to provoke you with their guns, just like the case of <a href=\"http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/647733/up-professor-in-road-rage-files-raps-vs-bulacan-mayor\">UP Dean Raul Pangalangan.</a>\n\nFrom my daily road observations, I can classify four types of drivers that need rehabilitation: 1.) Reckless Driver; 2.) Selfish Driver; 3.) Insensitive Driver; 4.) Stupid Driver\n<ol>\n	<li>The <strong>reckless driver</strong> is the driver who doesn\'t care for his safety, his passengers, pedestrians or other commuters. Both public and private drivers are guilty of this. In EDSA for instance, buses are really doing an implicit drag racing to get more passengers and to piss off other vehicles. The scary part here is that with their carelessness, it can lead to fatalities. I remembered when I was driving from Q. Ave to EDSA. I overtook a Don Mariano bus. It was a clean and courteous overtake because it\'s slow, there was a wide distance and I used my signal. I assumed the driver got very angry because he started blowing the horn very loudly and he wanted to hit me by over speeding and destroying the car. I could sense it because he had not no intention of stopping. He\'s very fast while hitting the horn in high beam lights at my back. I had not choice but to speed up and lost him in Monumento. Very scary and very reckless. A reckless driver can destroy a car, just like what happened to this <a href=\"http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/670638/collision-causes-bus-to-roll-over-flatten-sedan\">brand new Toyota Vios</a>. The worst thing it is that some of these reckless drivers don\'t have the feeling of remorse. I remember one incident when I was in a police station to file a police report regarding a collision with a tricycle early this year. A bus driver there was arrested for hitting and killing a pedestrian crossing the highway. In his face, there was no sign of regret. He was even laughing and making fun of the situation.</li>\n	<li><strong>Selfish drivers</strong> are drivers who only think about themselves. They want to get in the toll first without falling in line. Selfish drivers are prevalent in the Metro. For instance, during peak hours, I often go to Sct Ybardolaza for some shortcut routes. It\'s a two-lane, two-way road. However because the queue is getting longer, some private vehicles and UV express vans counterflow and then try to go back to the correct lane again. Imagine the deadlock! And they\'re the ones who are angry when you don\'t allow them to go back to the right lane! Same is true when there\'s a queue under a flyover, service road. Drivers will drive very fast on the flyover lane and will swerve to change to the service road lane in the last seconds, causing traffic for all!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_412\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/11535883_1007154282636733_8378717504819942211_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-412 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/11535883_1007154282636733_8378717504819942211_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"11535883_1007154282636733_8378717504819942211_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a> Usual scenario. This Innova suddenly goes to the service road lane without any signal and queuing. He came from the flyover lane. Worst effect is that many cars followed him causing heavier traffic.[/caption]</li>\n	<li><strong>Insensitive drivers</strong> are drivers who don\'t care about the situation of others. They are usually drivers of Public Utility Vehicles (PUV\'s). For jeepneys, this happens when they load and unload at the corner side of an intersection, blocking those vehicles turning their direction.In EDSA, most of them are buses that load and unload in the middle of the road or at the start of a flyover.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_409\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10431552_939547516064077_513301130625923672_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-409\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/10431552_939547516064077_513301130625923672_n.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"Multiple buses parking in their terminal. causing heavy traffic during peak hours. \" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> Multiple buses parking in their terminal causing heavy traffic during peak hours. The driver in front of me was already going out in anger to shout at the drivers/MMDA enforcers.[/caption]</li>\n	<li>Lasty, the <strong>stupid drivers</strong> are drivers that have expensive cars, but act like an asshole. They are the ones who park in the PWD parking slots even if they have no PWD passengers. They will block the driveway beside a No Parking Sign. They wouldn\'t pay a parking fee and just park along the no-parking, no-waiting road but they own a Lexus with a driver. There was a <a href=\"http://www.topgear.com.ph/features/motoring-tales/video-this-is-how-they-tow-a-range-rover-sport-in-bonifacio-global-city\">news about a Range Rover </a>towed in BGC and the netizens were very angry at the BGC guards on the manner how the towing was made. My point is, why will you get angry at the BGC guards? The drivers there know that it\'s a no-parking zone, why won\'t you park in a decent parking space? You can afford a Range Rover but can\'t afford a P40 parking fee?</li>\n</ol>\n[caption id=\"attachment_405\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10247355_778414282177402_2259644640927870311_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-405 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/10247355_778414282177402_2259644640927870311_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10247355_778414282177402_2259644640927870311_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> At least he folded the side mirror before leaving his car.[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_406\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10486213_806431616042335_8373302947700304726_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-406 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/10486213_806431616042335_8373302947700304726_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10486213_806431616042335_8373302947700304726_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> Illiterate or \'elite\'-rate?[/caption]\n\nThe Philippines has still a lot of way to go to elevate its standard in driving. I think we can\'t blame everything in the government. The government lacks a lot. They have a rotten system in implementing the rules. But I think that doesn\'t mean that we should adapt with these corrupt practices.\n\nIf somehow, you can relate in one of these types of drivers, simply reverse its description and you can, in a small way, help the society. For example, if you are a selfish driver, why don\'t you give way to people who would like to overtake with the proper distance and signal? My officemate told me that he doesn\'t use signals anymore because most cars don\'t give to other cars that use signals. What topsy-turvy world we\'re living in!\n\nIf a middle-class car owner can pay for a parking fee to avoid being towed and not to contribute to traffic, why won\'t you a Lamborghini owner park in the parking space too? I was very furious 2 weeks ago that there was a Jaguar parked (no driver in the car) across our Net Lima office in BGC. The BGC guard in motorcycle didn\'t mind the parked car even if they have a strict rule on no-parking/no-waiting in the streets of BGC. Just right after the Jaguar, there\'s a parked motorcycle, that obviously was driven by a delivery boy. The BGC guard immediately called the towing team to get the motorcycle. The guards of Chinabank called the delivery boy to run and get his motorcycle. The motorcycle wasn\'t towed but the driver was scolded by the BGC guard and humiliated in public\n\n... while the Jaguar beside it was just parked peacefully. Son of a gun!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_404\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1507592_745213575497473_2041896186_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-404\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/1507592_745213575497473_2041896186_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Some parishioners of Don Bosco Makati complained on this new rule of the parish.

Cars can no longer enter the parking area if it is already \"Full Parking.\" Apparently, they don\'t want to pay a parking fee in Makati Square and instead they just want to double-park.

In this case, we answered the following questions:\n\n• What is the profile of the company?\n• What were the challenges faced by the company?\n• What is the core business of the company?\n• How did the company address the challenges?\n• What are the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches/strategy implemented?\n• Give your recommendation/s on how to:\n– Maintain customer satisfaction\n– Improve customer relationship\n• Cite at least five (5) best practices presented in the case.\n\nMy groupmate Tezza created a Powtoon video summarizing our answers <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cPusLBXXT8\">here</a>.\n\nBasically, we discussed and learned the importance of the Stock Control Management (SCM) system because the company needs to ensure that they have the correct number of food stock- just the right amount for the week. This will ensure that the food is fresh and will be available to customers availing the products.\n\nAnother case that gave me a lot of interest was the <a href=\"http://www1.firstdirect.com/1/2/banking/ways-to-bank/online-banking\">First Direct Online Banking</a>. This case is very interesting because it\'s the only back that is 100% virtual. The big challenge there was, how do they establish \"trust\" with their customers? The discussion about the case was interactive.\n\nOn some other cases, the reporter was solving the case based on his experience in his work. Sir Je reminded us about \"paradigm paralysis,\" a problem when we place things based on our experience and perspective. Sometimes this causes confusion and misunderstanding of the challenges of the case.\n\nWe also checked some submissions on value chain organizational chart. We were reminded not to confuse \"roles\" vs \"functions.\" Engineer is a role while \"Engineering\" is a function.\n\nLastly, I learned that i<strong>t is more expensive to get a new customer than maintaining a customer.</strong> That\'s why customer relationship is essential.

(419,	1,	'2015-07-13 10:17:44',	'2015-07-13 10:17:44',	'\n				I\'m referencing and acknowledging this blog: https://sopinion8ed.wordpress.com/category/strategic-alignment/page/3/ for showing the Strategic Alignment Model that is useful in determining the status of a company:\n\n<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/strategic-alignment1.png\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-420 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/strategic-alignment1.png?w=300\" alt=\"strategic-alignment1\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /></a>\n\nWe learned different assessment tools to determine the organization\'s standpoint based on their business strategy and IT strategy. We discussed the strategic alignment to see if the Business Strategy is complemented by the IT strategy counterpart. The model is used to check (and calibrate if necessary) the current state of the organization and determine what adjustments can be made.\n\nFor example, in one of the models the company is rated as \"Proactive\" (which is high, technology-based, top-down) but in terms of maturity, it is still in Application Silo (low for maturity), then this means that there\'s something that needs to be calibrated in the strategic alignment.\n\n<hr />\n\nOn another note, I learned that the term \"usability\" does not only equate to ease of use but also ease of learning. Also, I learned that the initial intention of Microsoft with the default installation of games (such as Solitaire, Minesweeper etc.) was not for entertainment but to teach the early users of GUI learn the functionalities of the mouse.\n\n<hr />\n\nRegarding the analysis of case studies, we were reminded not only to create SMART objectives, but formulate also in a strategic level perspective. (There are 3 levels of strategy - Strategic (high), Tactical and Operational (low)) This should also be applied in the formulation of problems. Lastly, we were advised that asking if a particular model is useful in determining an outcome when creating a problem statement is also acceptable.

In our case, our organization is a Data Center. We presented our value chain but the comment was that the focus should be on the \"space rental\" service. We discussed the need of managing the servers and other features such as asset keeping and security of data.\n\nIn relation to this, we learned in class that SM (Shoe Mart) is nor a retail business. It is actually a real estate business. SM leases its space to different companies that sell products. They rent the space and the location of that space. For example, a known brand will pay the consumer eye-level space while the company that has no budget can only opt to lease the low-level space. We also discussed how SM Bonus products are leveled with the known brands so that consumers can see the comparison in terms of price.\n\nI had a lot of realizations after that discussion. It is really true that SM does that! They are really good in business and making money.\n\nTwo of my classmates reported for the day, the first one\'s topic is virtualization while the other one is data hosting. Both reports were very informative.

Thanks for the resources and lessons, Sir Fiel! :)\n\nWe presented the revised draft of our Shanghai Bell. We nailed the objective and problem statement. It\'s the first time in class that a group was able to provide that correct objective and problem statement! It was a morale booster. Sir Fiel accepted the problem statement but reminded us that the case facts must support the problem. In the end, the our solution must be a data-driven decision.\n\nHe also commented on our Alternative Actions. He said that alternative actions must be able to answer the problem posted. So in our case, we are asking for the IS strategy that can be used. The alternative actions must be strategy too. For the recommendations, we need to recommend based on the frameworks that we studied also. For example, if in the case study the organization is still in the Reactive phase then the recommendation can suggest ways on how the organization can become Proactive.\n\nWe were reminded by Sir Fiel, \"What you feel good doesn\'t necessarily mean appropriate.\" I think this reminder is very true because we tend to do things based on our \"feel\" sometimes or for some, most of the time.\n\nOne thing I learned in this meeting which is applicable to my everyday life encounter is \"Don\'t give all your technical expertise.\" Based on Sir Fiel\'s experience, he didn\'t think of the fact that he can earn money from his advice to his company. I have that same \"share the knowledge\" tendency though. But I learned that meeting that you need to keep something for yourself also. You need to have some strong edge later on.

Network Architect - Designs the network topology and chooses the devices in building the network infrastructure.\n\n2. Network Engineer - Configures and implements network infrastructure.\n\n3. Network Administrator - Facilitates, maintains and operates day to day network operations.\n\n4. Procurement Officer - Provides options for device and service acquisition. Responsible for pre-procurement, procurement and post-procurement.\n\nNote: A member may be assigned multiple roles if you lack manpower. Also, a role may be used twice if you have more than 4 members. In short, you need to ensure all roles have corresponding members.\n\n<strong>Case:</strong>\n\nGhana IT Services Inc. is an SME company located in Ayala Ave., Makati City, Philippines. The company sells security appliances such as Firewall, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and a combination of both, the Unified Threat Management System (UTM). They also provide 24/7 monitoring of these devices as they are a Managed Service Security Provider (MSSP). Currently, it has 120 employees divided into the following groups:\n\nAdministration (Led by the VP-Administration)\n\n- Finance &amp; Accounting\n\n- Sales &amp; Marketing\n\n- HR\n\n- Audit\n\nOperations (Led by the VP-Operations)\n\n- Security Operations Center (This department monitors the health and logs produced by the managed devices)\n\n- IT Support Group (Technical support of IT services)\n\n- Deployment Engineering (Responsible for installing and fixing deployed devices)\n\n<strong>Issues:</strong>\n\n1. Ghana IT Services would like to setup another location to make it an alternate yet operational site. This is to ensure business continuity among its services in case of power loss or calamities.\n\n2. They want to expand their market in the Visayas and Mindanao regions. All departments must be replicated in these regions as well.\n\n3. They are operating 24/7. This means that services and products that they are offering should have High Availability (HA)\n\n4. There is an increase in employees, 10% every year.\n\n<strong>Tasks:</strong>\n\n1. Create a 3-year network management and design plan that will address the following issues:\n\n- Fault Tolerance (How will you resolve the issue of High Availability?)\n\n- Scalability (There is an expected increase in the employee headcount. How will you address this?)\n\n- Quality of Service (Which departments do you think need more bandwidth? How will you implement it?)\n\n- Security (How will client data be secured? How about communication and storage security? Can employees work from home?)\n\n2. The network architect must provide the logical topology of the network, communicating all 3 branches, the IP addressing used and other relevant network information.\n\n3. Procurement Officer must provide a list of services (ISP) and a table of security appliances (at least 3 brands for comparison) determined by the network architect.\n\n4. Network architect must choose and justify the options given by the procurement officer.\n\n5. Network engineer must configure the network provided by the network architect using Packet Tracer. (Note: Device brands chosen by the network architect may differ. Even if you are using Packet Tracer, you are assuming you are implementing the brand that you have chosen.)\n\n6. Network administrator must determine the daily routines he is doing for network infrastructure. Specifically:\n\n- Network Level: How do you patch the servers? When do you conduct patch management?\n\n- Host Level: How do you provide access control to users? Do you have any anti-virus solutions installed? Do you conduct auditing?\n\n- Application Level: What are the default programs installed in the company computers?\n\n<strong>Deadlines:</strong>\n\nThis activity will be done during our class on August 4, 2015.\n\n<strong>Deliverables:</strong>\n\n1.

It was quite challenging because the audience were not familiar with IT concepts.\n\nI started by showing them local news about hacking data in banks. Then I established the need for the information security field. I discussed the core concepts of information security.\n\nI also talked about the steps in ethical hacking and the reason why it has to be conducted routinely. Lastly, I stressed the need for a cybercrime law that will protect our data handled by third-party organizations.\n\nThe presentation I used and created can be found here: <a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/patts_infosecethicalhacking101.pdf\">PATTS_Infosec&amp;EthicalHacking101</a>\n\nSpecial thanks to Prof. Diana Lachica for inviting me to their campus. :)\n\n<em>Photo Credit: Ashley Dy</em>\n\n<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/10984111_1030960710256090_2495478400270029599_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-445 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/10984111_1030960710256090_2495478400270029599_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10984111_1030960710256090_2495478400270029599_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/11145182_1030960843589410_5172429549901189908_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-446 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/11145182_1030960843589410_5172429549901189908_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"11145182_1030960843589410_5172429549901189908_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/11693961_1030960750256086_6222822229063846860_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-447 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/11693961_1030960750256086_6222822229063846860_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"11693961_1030960750256086_6222822229063846860_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/11813264_1030960723589422_614397325621181618_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-448 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/11813264_1030960723589422_614397325621181618_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"11813264_1030960723589422_614397325621181618_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/11822705_1030960820256079_7745031637066193848_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-449 aligncenter\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/11822705_1030960820256079_7745031637066193848_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"11822705_1030960820256079_7745031637066193848_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>		',	'Information Security & Ethical Hacking 101 @ PATTS',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'information-security-ethical-hacking-101-patts',	'',	'',	'2015-08-11 13:15:19',	'2015-08-11 13:15:19',	'',	0,	'https://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=444',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

I am also trained to express my thoughts in class and defend the group’s answers. This is somehow new to me because in the technical world I just sit at my workstation for 8 hours.\n\nIn this course, I have to read and think critically about the case and look at all the possible perspectives to resolve the problem (as what Sir Fiel taught us). This is way contrary to a regular work where the same task is repeated daily. This is what makes the work easier- repetition. In analyzing the cases, the problem differs and it has to be dealt with in different approaches.\n\nSharing thoughts is also something new for me also. I teach in the undergraduate level too but mostly the talk comes from me. Students just listen. Most of the time, they will just accept what I say without question or doubt. In the MSPOLIS class, I have to think twice, thrice or more than that before I say my piece. There’s always debate, which I think is very helpful, on why the answer is this or that. I am always challenged and it give me enjoyment and satisfaction also.\n\nOne important thing that I have learned is to think “strategically.” I’ve been exposed to answer the questions in the operational level, because I’m part of the Information Risk Management (IRM) team. I have been depending my answer also to my work or how our department works. In analyzing the cases, I learned that I should detach myself from my work and how my department operates. Otherwise, it might affect how I make my analysis for the case.\n\nPrimus Inter Pares – This is one statement I learned in class. I have always wondered why we are always told that are answers are wrong. I seldom hear the words “correct,” “very good,” and “you’re right.” I don’t know if this is a teaching style to explicitly and repeatedly point out what’s wrong. Then I learned the meaning of the maxim. The teacher is just first among equals. He’s just ahead of us. I believe the same explanation given and I guess it’s applicable even in the industry. But at some point the same skills need to be transferred to somebody else so the cycle goes on.\n\nI also learned about problems on ERP implementation. I’ve read and we’ve discussed in class different cases like Ashvini and Shanghai Bell about the failures on ERP implementation. Relating it to the real world, I realized the importance of business strategy and strategic alignment. Usually, when technical people enter the field, they are already utilizing the ERP service so we tend to forget or evaluate how it was made.\n\nI learned in the strategic alignment that business strategy and IT strategy should be aligned together so the IT implementations like ERP will be successful. Also, I learned that by understanding and applying the IS assessment tools, I will be able to determine the current state of the organization and use it to determine its future.\n\nLastly, I learned the importance of IT governance in an organization. I remembered when I first entered Coca-Cola, there’s somehow a discrimination against the job role. Most SAP employees felt they were being discriminated against by the Marketing and Sales group. They claim that they were branded as “cost centers” of the company. I look at IT governance in a way where people are able to give value to the business. For instance, I’m in security and to show my value to the company, I tell them how much the company saves from vulnerability and penetration testing. This helps the company determine that my role is necessary because it is already a profit center rather than cost center.

Per the advice of my colleague at work, I tried renewing the car registration at LTO P. Tuazon branch in Quezon City.\n\n[caption width=\"300\" id=\"attachment_460\" align=\"aligncenter\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lto_ptuazonmap.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-460\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/lto_ptuazonmap.png?w=300\" alt=\"Location of LTO P.

Tuazon[/caption]<strong>Car Registration Renewal</strong>\n\nIt only took me 10 minutes to sign up and check in an emission testing center. The good thing is, there\'s no queue because of the oversupply of the emission testing centers around the area. The testing fee is P450.\n\nI went directly straight to the LTO office afterwards. LTO personnel are on standby and will guide you to park insideou the area. They will ask you to get a registration form in the booth outside and they will do the stencil. The stencil will take around 10 minutes. Once it is done, the LTO personnel will escort you inside the office and somebody will check your documents.\n\nThe following documents are required for renewal:\n<ul>\n	<li>Registration form</li>\n	<li>Photocopy of OR/CR</li>\n	<li>Emission Test Result</li>\n	<li>TPL from your car insurance</li>\n</ul>\nAfter your documents are evaluated, you will be asked to pay for the total bill of <strong>P2,779.06.</strong> After a couple of minutes, you will be able to get your OR. Unfortunately, the new plates and stickers are still not available. But overall, it only took me 30 minutes from car stencil to releasing of OR.\n\n[caption width=\"169\" id=\"attachment_466\" align=\"aligncenter\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/img_5500.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-466 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/img_5500.png?w=169\" alt=\"IMG_5500\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\"></a> Car registration renewal costs P2,779.06.

I learned that some LTO sites already have the plastic cards. So I called their hotline at <strong>7237740</strong>. I was informed that they conduct LTO renewal and they have the plastic cards already!\n\nSo the next day, I went to the LTO site. I was instructed to have a medical exam across the building. I went to Precision Drug Test and Medical Clinic. Drug test is no longer required. The medical exam includes eye check, BP and weight. The test costs <strong>P150</strong>.\n\n[caption width=\"225\" id=\"attachment_463\" align=\"aligncenter\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/img_5470.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-463 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/img_5470.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"IMG_5470\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\"></a> Precision Drug Test and Medical Clinic right across the LTO office[/caption]\n[caption width=\"225\" id=\"attachment_464\" align=\"aligncenter\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/img_5472.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-464 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/img_5472.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"IMG_5472\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\"></a> Medical test is only P150.

Then, proceed to Window 11 (Cashier) for payment. I paid a total of <strong>P417.63</strong> for the license.\n\nYou will get the license card immediately in Window 4 once you get the receipt.\n\n[caption width=\"225\" id=\"attachment_467\" align=\"aligncenter\"]<a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/img_5501.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-467 size-medium\" src=\"https://justinspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/img_5501.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"IMG_5501\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\"></a> License renewal only costs P417.63[/caption]In total, it took me 30 minutes to renew my license including the medical exam.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Summary:</span>\n\nLicense - P 417.63 (20 minutes)\n\nMedical - P 150.00 (10 minutes)\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Total - P 567.63</strong></span>\n\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\n\nThis is the first time I have found a very friendly and accommodating government office. All employees are very accommodating and smiling sincerely. They look happy with their work. Their system is very systematic and efficient. In terms of the volume of the customers, there are at least 40 people at a time doing transactions, waiting etc. They have clean restroom as well and air-conditioned (well-ventilated) office. Those LTO personnel who are helping and guiding are not asking for tips or asking for bribes.\n\nThe only disadvantage is that there are few parking spaces around the area. Better ride Uber or train going there if you don\'t want to be stressed out. :)\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this LTO office branch for your car registration and license renewal.

(470,	1,	'2015-09-01 11:29:04',	'2015-09-01 11:29:04',	'\n				I learned last week that my mom was trying to set a dentist appointment for cleaning and pasta. Currently, she is my dependent in my HMO plan from my employer. I was surprised to learn that one clinic, didn\'t accommodate her in setting an appointment. The dentist himself told her over the phone that Saturday and Sunday were fully booked. He then informed her that she can try on Tuesday again. When my mom told the dentist that she would like to book the appointment, the dentist said it\'s not allowed. She can only book on the day itself because the clinic is giving priority to customers who go for service without using the HMO card. In short, those who are paying in cash.\n\nI was very furious about the incident. Thinking back, I actually experienced similar incidents. In my previous company, the health provider has a lifestyle clinic near our office. I scheduled for appointment with their dentist. When I arrived there, the dentist was very ill-tempered to her clients. When it was my turn, she was scolding me about not taking care of my teeth. During the procedure, she used her tools very hard that a lot of my teeth bled. It was my first time to experience such painful experience!\n\nAnother instance was when I went to the clinic near my place because I was feeling sick. I was having cough, colds and headache. When the doctor called me in, he kept on asking if I was smoking. I repeatedly answered no but he was insisting otherwise. I was really positive I didn\'t do nor say anything that would make him hostile at me. Was is because I was just using my HMO card and not a regular paying client/patient? Surely the mood was different when the same doctor accommodated the earlier customer.\n\nI have heard a lot of horror stories from my colleagues and friends regarding deprioritization or discrimination of clients or even patients using health cards compared to regular paying clients.\n\nI have never thought that some doctors will resort to choosing which to cater first based on the payment method the client will be using. In my mom\'s case, why will the dentist choose the regular paying than the one who came in first? That\'s a very problematic premise.\n\nMy question for these doctors is, if somebody goes to you for treatment, would you care less if the person is using his/her health card? And, will you treat the patient differently if he/she is paying in cash?\n\nMy only point is this: If you do not want compiled payments every month because of the health card\'s policy then don\'t join or partner with these health providers. If you want instant cash every time you conduct your check up, that\'s fine. But don\'t deprive people their access to health care just because they\'re using their HMO cards.\n\nRemember your Hippocratic Oath! In the end, I wonder a lot. If these \"physicians\" get paid even if the clients are using their health cards, why do they discriminate them? Aren\'t these business generating doctors trying to evade paying taxes when they get their pay? I wonder too, how many of them do issue receipts after a regular paying client\'s consultation?

More importantly, the curriculum followed is the CompTIA Security+ lessons. The final project\'s objective is to be able to explore on security tools and software such as firewall, IDS, honeypot and to demonstrate the functionalities by doing test scenarios.\n\nFor COMSEC1, the focus shifts into a more specific topic on ethical hacking. The course discusses the steps on ethical hacking and its importance. For the final project, students are required to conduct a static code analysis and vulnerability scan in an existing project and fix the risks to an acceptable risk level.\n\nSome of the projects include:\n\nWeb application - <a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/web_comsec1.pdf\">Web_COMSEC1</a>\n\nMobile application - <a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mobile_comsec1.pdf\">Mobile_COMSEC1</a>		',	'COMSEC1 - Culminating Project',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'comsec2-culminating-project',	'',	'',	'2015-09-19 08:12:28',	'2015-09-19 08:12:28',	'',	0,	'https://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=476',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

Actually, expert is a very dangerous and overrated term and usually lambasted by Powerpoint consultants.  I agree that experience is the best teacher but it becomes helpful if the experience is \'fruitful\'. I had a conversation with a former colleague of mine who told me that it doesn\'t matter if you have 10 years of experience if the function is just the same. You become knowledgeable about this specific work in the first year and repeat it in the next 9 years. Is that 10 year experience then significant? Or this experience only has the same weight of an employee in its second year doing the same job?\n\n[gallery ids=\"1309,1310\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nThere is a perpetual debate whether there is value in an IT certification. Some say that certification validates your knowledge of the subject matter while others say that it is just a marketing strategy of vendors. Some say that you can pass a certification by just memorizing stuff or worse, cheat to pass. However, I think we have to put into perspective the reason why these certifications are created.\n\nPersonally, I think the reasons why certifications exist are to standardize, validate and educate. Now, I know for a fact that nothing beats experience. It invalidates, however, this fact if you just ping the servers, assign IP\'s to computers and create an Excel report using Pivot table for the next 20 years. Certification is a qualification. If you say in an HR interview, \"I\'m an expert in database management.\" but you don\'t have any certification to support that, then how can you claim this assertion? Probably you will answer, \"My peers, friends and parents can vouch for me.\" Unfortunately, the HR won\'t take your parents\' word for your skill something objective. Looking at the other side, the good question could be, \"If you really are good in database, why don\'t you just take a DB2 exam to validate it?\"\n\nLastly, I think certifications try to cover all the topics, not just some points you\'re expert in. Because it is a standard, it teaches you how to, for example, program properly and efficiently. It teaches you other techniques that you may not have known or tried yet.\n\nExperience and certification complement each other. However, you cannot discredit the benefits of having a certification. In a similar way, most IT jobs require that you are a graduate of a 4-year course. That is actually the first qualification. Regardless whether you have 10 years of experience, you need to be a graduate to be qualified. It might just be a piece of paper, but that is the qualification.\n\nI encourage my students in college to take certification exams as early as possible if they think they are ready and prepared. This helps them build their confidence and portfolio. Once they graduate, probably tens of thousands of IT graduates will be competing for jobs available. How will you standout if you\'re competing with students from top schools or those graduated with honors? I strongly believe certifications will be of great value.\n\nAdmittedly, I had horrible experiences with \"certified professionals\" who are incompetent with their areas of expertise. I had an experience where I asked what protocol is ICMP (ping) and he insisted that it is using TCP. He was a Cisco Certified Networking Professional (intermediate certification). Of course, he didn\'t get the job. But these scenarios happen in different venues. In the academe, there are PhD\'s who ironically don\'t know how to cite sources properly. I mean there are good and bad apples. At the end of the day, the first question is, are you qualified? And the second is, can you verify that you are qualified?\n\nIt\'s like, you claim you know how to drive because you really know how to drive. But no matter how good your driving skills are, you cannot drive without a license.\n\nSimilarly... there are very bad drivers who have licenses.\n\n<strong>References:</strong>\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/certification-overview.aspx#/\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications.html		',	'Is there really value in an IT Certification?',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'the-value-of-an-it-certification',	'',	'',	'2015-10-02 11:52:17',	'2015-10-02 11:52:17',	'',	0,	'https://justinspeaks.wordpress.com/?p=480',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

The second half of the term is dedicated for the simulation on how an operating system works.\n<h1>Review</h1>\nDuring the discussion of processes, we have defined it as a program in <em>execution</em>. It has, in simplest forms, three states: <strong>Ready state, Running state and the Blocked state</strong>. For the purposes of process scheduling, we will limit ourselves with the three states and not anymore use the expanded one. All processes reside in the Ready state, particularly in the <strong>ready queue</strong> prior to its execution. Also, only one process is executed at a time. <strong>Context switching</strong> happens when a process is switched from the ready to the running state or vice versa.\n\nWe also learned that <strong>all processes in the ready state reside in the RAM</strong> while a <strong>running process is found in the processor.</strong>\n<h1>Terms</h1>\n<ol>\n	<li>Arrival Time (AT) – Time when the process reaches the Ready Queue (RQ).</li>\n	<li>Burst Time (BT) – Total execution or service time of a process.</li>\n	<li>Turnaround Time (TAT) – Total time from the time a process arrives in the RQ until it finishes its execution.</li>\n	<li>Waiting Time (WT) – Total wait time before the process gets executed.</li>\n	<li>Time Quantum (TQ) – Time given to a process to execute before switching to the next process.</li>\n	<li>Response Ratio (RR2) – Value computed to determine the balance between processes based on AT and BT</li>\n	<li>Start Time (ST) – Time when process starts executing.</li>\n	<li>Completed Time (CT) – Time when process finishes executing.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Requirements</h1>\nBy default, you are required to show the following in all algorithms that will be discussed:\n<ol>\n	<li>∑BT (10%) – Summation BT or Sigma BT is the total BT of all processes in the Process Table.</li>\n	<li>Gantt Chart (60%) – This shows the order of the execution of processes with its time.</li>\n	<li>Performance Table (30%) – Show the TAT and WT of the processes.</li>\n</ol>\n<u>Note:</u> The Gantt Chart is the most important requirement. A correct Gantt Chart is a prerequisite of a correct performance table.\n<h1>Example Process Table</h1>\nFor all algorithms, we will be using this process table:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\"><strong>Process</strong></td>\n<td width=\"208\"><strong>AT</strong></td>\n<td width=\"208\"><strong>BT</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\">P1</td>\n<td width=\"208\">2</td>\n<td width=\"208\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\">P2</td>\n<td width=\"208\">3</td>\n<td width=\"208\">6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\">P3</td>\n<td width=\"208\">4</td>\n<td width=\"208\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\">P4</td>\n<td width=\"208\">5</td>\n<td width=\"208\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\"></td>\n<td width=\"208\">∑BT</td>\n<td width=\"208\">21</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<u>Note:</u> ∑BT is always the same regardless of the algorithm used.\n<h1>Algorithms</h1>\nThere are 5 algorithms that will be discussed: First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First- Non Preemptive (SJF-NP), Shortest Job First- Preemptive (SJF-P), Round Robin (RR) and Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN).\n<h2>First Come First Serve (FCFS)</h2>\n<h3>Quick Facts</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"123\"><strong>Criteria</strong></td>\n<td width=\"501\">Arrival Time (AT)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"123\"><strong>Description</strong></td>\n<td width=\"501\">First process to arrive gets executed first.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"123\"><strong>Mode</strong></td>\n<td width=\"501\">Non-Preemptive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"123\"><strong>Advantages</strong></td>\n<td width=\"501\">Simple to implement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"123\"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></td>\n<td width=\"501\">First process to arrive does not mean it is an important process.

The ultimate goal is for the students to come up with an outlook of the vulnerability on how it has affected and will affect the computing world in the future.\n\nFor instance, there Vulnerability X works on Platform Y.1. Computers need to update to Platform Y.2 to become protected. However, a lot of computers didn\'t update because of compatibility issues. What will happen to these \"unpatched computers?\" How many of them are found in critical data centers etc. Will Vulnerability X evolve into a more complex and more dangerous vulnerability?\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Sample works:</span>\n\nAndroid Rooting Vulnerability - <a title=\"Android Rooting\" href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/android-rooting.pdf\">Android Rooting</a>\n\niOs Jailbreak Vulnerability - <a title=\"iOS Jailbreak\" href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ios-jailbreak.pdf\">iOS Jailbreak</a>\n\nHeartbleed Vulnerability - <a title=\"Heartbleed\" href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/heartbleed.pdf\">Heartbleed</a>\n\nShellshock Vulnerability - <a title=\"Shellshock Vulnerability\" href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shellshock-vulnerability.pdf\">Shellshock Vulnerability</a>\n\nRemote Desktop Protocol Vulnerability - <a title=\"RDP\" href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rdp.pdf\">RDP</a>\n\nAdobe Flash Vulnerability - <a title=\"Adobe Flash\" href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/adobe-flash.pdf\">Adobe Flash</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;		',	'COMSEC2 Vulnerability POC and Analysis',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'comsec2-vulnerability-poc-and-analysis',	'',	'',	'2016-02-20 18:17:56',	'2016-02-20 18:17:56',	'',	0,	'http://justinpineda.com/?p=608',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

This course is usually taken by business students (in MBA) or even IT students since a lot of their subjects are business-related.\n\nAll I know about Strategic Management is that it is a high-level subject where the management plans the direction of the organization.\n\nWe had a brief discussion of the Product Lifecycle where the goal is to reach the maturity peak and remain there, otherwise the business will fall. (case on Nokia for instance)\n\nSome questions that are asked include:\n<ul>\n	<li>Where are we?</li>\n	<li>Where do we want to go?</li>\n	<li>How do we get there?</li>\n</ul>\nSome strategy approaches include:\n<ol>\n	<li>PESTLE</li>\n	<li>Industry Life Cycle</li>\n	<li>SWOT</li>\n	<li>Critical Success Factors Analysis</li>\n	<li>Value Chain</li>\n	<li>Porter\'s 5- forces</li>\n</ol>\nAgain, this is a very new subject for me especially because this is a management course.

At was I thought doing the PESTLE analysis is very easy since you are just going to list down all impacts on the business based on: Political, Economical, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental aspects. But I realized later on how essential this is for an investor. We were assigned to explore on the logistics industry in the Philippines. And we found out that there are a lot of issues that will be faced by investors that are not usually experienced in other countries like corruption, bribery, traffic, floods, looting etc.\n\nYou can check out our PESTLE analysis for the Logistics Industry below:\n\n<a title=\"Report1_MSSTRAM\" href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/report1_msstram.pdf\">Report1_MSSTRAM</a>\n\n<a title=\"Report1_MSSTRAM_presentation\" href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/report1_msstram_presentation.pdf\">Report1_MSSTRAM_presentation</a>		',	'Learning Log 2 - PESTLE Analysis',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'learning-log-2-pestle-analysis',	'',	'',	'2016-03-18 08:43:25',	'2016-03-18 08:43:25',	'',	0,	'http://justinpineda.com/?p=647',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

This will be able to maximize the technologies\' functionalities, and be able to choose the right innovations to implement and avoid unnecessary costs.\n\nI was really amazed at the realization that previously, the role of IT is only a support service is in the value chain. After applying Earl\'s Multiple Methodology, it is now very evident the IT has a very crucial role in the CSF of the business.\n\nFor example in the our company, the role of technology now is very essential in expanding its marketing and sales strategy. The advertisement campaigns and promotions are now in mobile and web applications because more and more customers are using the social media and smart phones to communicate and interact.\n\nAccording the Earl, the methodology is three-pronged, consisting of the following:\n<ol>\n	<li>Business Plans and Goals (Top down)</li>\n	<li>Current Systems (Bottom up)</li>\n	<li>IT Opportunities (Inside out)</li>\n</ol>\nThe business plans and goals are strategic, high-level and generic. It is applied in the organization as a whole. For the current systems, it contains the specific technologies that are already implemented in the organization. The IT opportunities are the \"proposed\" innovations that will help the organization achieve the business plans and goals.\n\n&nbsp;		',	'Learning Log 6 – Earl’s Multiple Methodology and CSF',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'learning-log-6-earls-multiple-methodology-and-csf',	'',	'',	'2016-04-16 03:33:56',	'2016-04-16 03:33:56',	'',	0,	'http://justinpineda.com/?p=715',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

I find it very useful for me to understand human capital so that I can be able to cope up with the needs of the global economy. I realized that even though there are a lot of job opportunities available because of the BPO and Shared Servcies trend here in the Philippines, a lot of jobs can be easily removed and replaced.\n\nFrom the Maslow\'s Hierarchy of Needs, there are different levels of need a person will encounter in his life- Physiological, Safety and Security, Social, Esteem, Self-Actualization.  As he matures, he goes up to another level. A challenge or change in his life may move him up or down one level. This is the objective each person should follow. At some point in your life, you will reach Self-Actualization and won\'t strive hard in toiling to live.\n\nThere are different types of skills- Commodity, Leveraged and Proprietary Skills. Commodity skills are skills that can be found in most people. Meaning, there is a big supply of it. Leveraged Skills are skills that can be found in a specific industry. Proprietary skills are skills that are necessary for a particular country to run. Obviously, we need to be able to acquire leveraged and proprietary skills.\n\nThe interesting part is the Human Capital Matrix:\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-753\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hcm.png\" alt=\"hcm\" width=\"364\" height=\"237\" />\n\n(Image from Prof. Jerald Dela Rosa\'s slide)\n\nYou can classify your role based on the Availability of Skills and Knowledge and Value Created to Organization.You can now easily determine whether your role is either easy or difficult to replace and it provides value to the company.\n<ul>\n	<li>Easy to Replace and Low Value Added can be automated.</li>\n	<li>Easy to Replace and High Value Added can be outsourced.</li>\n	<li>Difficult to Replace and Low Value Added can be used to informate</li>\n	<li>Difficult to Replace and High Value Added skills are capitalized.</li>\n</ul>\nThe ultimate goal is to have a difficult to replace and high value added skills.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;		',	'Learning Log 1: Understanding Human Capital',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'learning-log-1-understanding-human-capital',	'',	'',	'2016-07-08 23:23:08',	'2016-07-08 23:23:08',	'',	0,	'http://justinpineda.com/?p=739',	0,	'post',	'',	1),

That\'s why it\'s really important for the parents to be a role-models for their children. And I realized that it\'s hard for OFW parents to be able to balance on sustaining the needs of their family and giving good influence to their offspring while they are away.\n\nThen here comes transactional analysis. I learned that we can as act one of the following- child, parent or adult.\n\nImagine that in every scenario that you encounter, you can now tagged if the action is coming from a child, parent or adult.\n<ul>\n	<li>If you are using mostly emotions with less logic, you can be classified as acting like a child.</li>\n	<li>If you are acting like an authoritarian  you can be classified as acting like a parent.</li>\n	<li>If you are adapting maturely to the situation, then you\'re acting like an adult.</li>\n</ul>\nAfter the discussion, I learned that learning transactional analysis will help everybody analyze the situation first before responding. It will help everybody respond properly too. For example, if there is somebody who has a strong personality and conceited, you know that the person is acting like a child. Instead of acting like a child as well, you will instead try to understand the person and meet him/her halfway.\n\nI really enjoyed the session because I always do transactional analysis every time I encounter a questionable scenario. And it helps me choose to act like an adult.\n\n&nbsp;		',	'Learning Log 2: Transactional Analysis',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'learning-log-2-transactional-analysis',	'',	'',	'2016-07-09 08:18:05',	'2016-07-09 08:18:05',	'',	0,	'http://justinpineda.com/?p=766',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

I\'m actually trying to learn the different aspects of the information security domain and after experiencing these different roles, it will help me lead a team someday.\n\nThe discussion in class was actually a wake up call. I learned that in some ways that we do our role, we act as leaders- not necessarily we have the position or even the salary for it. I learned the leader can be: a steward, a designer and a teacher. The definition of a leader is very simplistic in the session and looking at the bigger picture- it\'s really true!\n\nThere are 4 straight to the point characteristics of a leader- character, competence, concern and communication. It\'s self-explanatory and you cross-reference it with your behavior and actions.\n\nI wrote a paper about my \"leadership experience\" and it can be found here: <a title=\"MCHMAN Paper on Leadership\" href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/mchman-paper-on-leadership.pdf\">MCHMAN Paper on Leadership</a>		',	'Learning Log 3: Leading the Knowledge Organization',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'learning-log-3-leading-the-knowledge-organization',	'',	'',	'2016-07-16 06:25:32',	'2016-07-16 06:25:32',	'',	0,	'http://justinpineda.com/?p=806',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

Companies need to be able to ask the right questions to cope up with the market and provide a sustainable product or service. However, a lot of ethical issues arise from doing competitive intelligence. For instance, is it ethical for telcos to give customer/subscriber information to third parties to offer you different products and services? What will you do if somebody gave you an intel about your company\'s competitor illegally?\n\nA good question to ask to determine if what you plan to do is ethical or not: Will a reasonable person do this action or not?\n\nAnother question is: If your competitor will do what you plan to do, do you think it is fair to you?\n\nI researched about Lenovo, which initially was about adware but later on I learned there\'s also an ethical issue because they\'re collecting personal info and give it to a third party for advertisements. You can check the paper here: <a title=\"Case Analysis Lenovo_PINEDA\" href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/case-analysis-lenovo_pineda.pdf\">Case Analysis Lenovo_PINEDA</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;		',	'Competitive Intelligence & Ethics',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'competitive-intelligence-ethics',	'',	'',	'2016-07-16 07:43:07',	'2016-07-16 07:43:07',	'',	0,	'http://justinpineda.com/?p=823',	0,	'post',	'',	0),
(839,	1,	'2016-08-20 06:33:48',	'2016-08-20 06:33:48',	'\n				The Case Studies in Human Capital Management are very interesting because these really are happening in the real world. Unfortunately, the issues are not discussed in the corporate world because it\'s quite taboo or sensitive.\n\nThe usual cases that we encounter in Human Capital are: 1. office politics; 2. unfair promotion; 3. too much expectation; 4. office relationship etc.\n\nOne common theme is about salary comparison and the value of \"loyalty\" in the company.\n\nWe discussed one case entitled \"Jecelie Claire\" which was created by our professor. It\'s about a conflict between 2 employees about salary and promotion.\n\nYou can find our report here: <a title=\"MSHCMAN Jecelie Claire\" href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/mshcman-jecelie-claire.pdf\">MSHCMAN Jecelie Claire</a>\n\n&nbsp;		',	'Learning Log 4: Human Capital Case Studies',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'learning-log-4-human-capital-case-studies',	'',	'',	'2016-08-20 06:33:48',	'2016-08-20 06:33:48',	'',	0,	'http://justinpineda.com/?p=839',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

Unfortunately, the company neither notices it nor gives value/invest on it.\n\nThat\'s why it\'s essential to classify tacit (implied) knowledge that contribute to the human capital of the organization. I have classified one useful and common skill that most information security professionals do that is not part of their role and undervalued by the organization yet it contributes a lot in the organization\'s human capital.\n\nI have examined a common skill by infosec professionals called \"Cyber Threat Intelligence\" (CTI) where the analysts are proactively look for attacks rather than reacting to it as they happen. They try to predict, analyze, detect and respond to Zero-day attacks too.\n\nI have created a model for it called CTI Knowledge Model.

Competence is the specified level of requirement to qualify for a particular role. There are a lot of job postings that show the competence level that the ideal candidate should have. However, sometimes the motivation of the headhunters is just to be able to recruit people for a high commission without validating the competence level of the applicant. This leads to a company employing an \"incompetent\" overpaid employee and giving commission to headhunting/recruitment agencies.\n\nCreating a table for competencies of an applicant is very important and should be clearly explained in detail so that matching it with the right person will be easy. One characteristic of a good Competency table is that it can be measured.\n\nMy competence table for an Application Security Specialist (generic) can be seen here- <a title=\"Competency\" href=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/competency.pdf\">Competency</a>		',	'Learning Log 6: Competence, Accountability & Indicators',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'learning-log-6-competence-accountability-indicators',	'',	'',	'2016-08-20 07:11:47',	'2016-08-20 07:11:47',	'',	0,	'http://justinpineda.com/?p=867',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

I\'ve been juggling a lot of things- my work at Coke, teaching and advising at APC, some consulting work and my Master\'s every Saturday.\n\nHopefully, I will be able to prioritize things this 2017. So, I have listed these concrete feasible steps to become better this year aka \"new year\'s resolution.\"\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Be healthy. Lose weight. Eat healthy. Get enough rest. Exercise.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nI was able to lose at least 25lbs in 2016 through a strict expensive diet and off to a personal diet. From almost 190 lbs, I\'m down to 163-165 lbs. But I\'m far from the weight that is appropriate for my height. I need to reach 140 lbs which I failed to hit by end of 2016. Hopefully, I can reach 140 lbs and maintain it. I plan to continue the personal cheap \"strict diet\" and everyday exercise (stationary biking, badminton and/or jogging).\n\nI also have to create a sleep routine and get 8 hours of sleep everyday. In 2016, I had the tendency to sleep 1-3 hours a day and take naps in between which was very unhealthy.\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Read and finish more books. </strong></li>\n</ul>\nI will update this and list down at least 1 book per month. (sorry for the very slow progress) I had to modify my resolution and include \"finish\" because I tend to buy a lot of books and not completely read it.\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Spend more time with family and friends.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nI have missed a lot of family and old-friends get-togethers because of work. I realized that it is not healthy to consistently skip them. I missed my close grandpa/uncle\'s 70th birthday. I missed visiting my grandpa\'s grave last All Souls\' Day and much more. I have to give time to them as well.\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Write more sensible and useful blogs/vlogs. </strong></li>\n</ul>\nI intend to write 3-7 blogs per week. haha I still think it\'s feasible.\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Travel to some personally unexplored places.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nI wasn\'t able to travel outside the country last year. I plan to travel more this year. Vietnam is a sure trip this January.\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Use money wisely.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nI had a lot of credit card abuse moments last year. In the latter part of 2016, I decided to stop using credit cards and instead pay in cash. I only use credit card for paying gas. I plan to cut unnecessary spending like Starbucks coffee, impulsive buying etc. I plan to set a limit for my spending so I can budget my money better.\n\nI remember one month last year, my credit card bill was around Php 60,000 and majority came from food trips! huhuhu :(\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Be more patient and kind to others</strong></li>\n</ul>\nI think slowly, I\'ve become patient and kind to those \"pasaway\" people. I realized by the end of 2016 that I have to take this to a higher level. I have to be more understanding to people who are just unworthy of love. hahaha There are a lot of these people I encounter everyday.\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Have some spiritual and quiet time everyday.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nI just have to thank God everyday which I tend to forget a lot of times last year.\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Limit use of social networking sites to 1 hour a day.</strong></li>\n</ul>\nDifficult to do but will try!\n\nSo what\'s your new year\'s resolution aside from going to the gym to lose weight? hahaha\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;		',	'Justin\'s 2017 New Year\'s Resolution',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'justins-2017-new-years-resolution',	'',	'',	'2017-01-01 14:13:52',	'2017-01-01 14:13:52',	'',	0,	'http://justinpineda.com/?p=899',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

I stayed in Hotel Camila 1 which is 15 minutes away from the airport. Most of the hotels provide a service from the airport to their place.\n\nThe hotel I stayed in was modest but it had the basic amenities in a usual hotel. For the 3 nights I stayed, I only paid around 3,300 pesos, although I had to buy breakfast on my own.\n\nDipolog is generally safe. The city is not yet fully developed and the mode of commute around the place is through tricycles. I was surprised because majority of the time that I was in the hotel, a lot of the people there were carrying guns. Some of them were in military uniform while others were not.\n\nThere were a couple of times too that we (Ashley and I) felt that somebody was following us. That\'s why I advise those who plan to visit to remain vigilant and alert always.\n\nThe tricycle drivers, waiters and waitresses, vendors, receptionists and majority of those I interacted with were helpful and hospitable. We were able to walk around the famous boardwalk at the Sunset Blvd. and had food trips in different restaurants/cafe such as D\'Hotel and Chapters A Book Cafe. One notable thing with their food is that it is cheap but with quality.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_976\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"960\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-976\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ncite3.jpg\" alt=\"ncite3\" width=\"960\" height=\"539\" /> From the airport[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_975\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"960\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-975\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ncite2.jpg\" alt=\"ncite2\" width=\"960\" height=\"539\" /> At Sunset Blvd.[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1024\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2592\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1024\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_20161022_105635.jpg\" alt=\"img_20161022_105635\" width=\"2592\" height=\"1456\" /> Selfie with Ashley en route to the Dipolog airport c/o Hotel Camila\'s service[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1010\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"4160\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1010\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_20161020_111130.jpg\" alt=\"img_20161020_111130\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2336\" /> One of Dipolog\'s Modern malls. :) [/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1008\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"4160\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1008\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_20161020_110749.jpg\" alt=\"img_20161020_110749\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2336\" /> Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral[/caption]		',	'Presented at the 14th NCITE and toured Dipolog City 2016',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'presented-at-the-14th-ncite-and-toured-dipolog-city-2016',	'',	'',	'2017-01-02 16:20:39',	'2017-01-02 16:20:39',	'',	0,	'http://justinpineda.com/?p=956',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

It\'s a short break from the stress in school. Looking at what I\'ve learned and accomplished so far, I would like to share my top 7 reasons why you should take up a Master\'s degree. (I\'m not going to discuss what course to take or which school should you go to. That will be in a another blog post. :) )\n<h1>7. You will meet new friends.</h1>\nThey say that in grad school, having 10 students in a class is already big. In the class, there will be mixed types of people- from young professionals to management-level to self-employed individuals. There will also be returnees or transferees who will join the class. Since a lot of them will be your classmates for a couple of terms, you spend a lot of time with them during and after class.\n\nAnd you will be friends with them in no time similar to your college experience! This time, you won\'t be limited to your age group. You can be a young professional and make friends with a senior manager or even a mother. And that\'s fine. :)\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1063\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"960\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1063\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mis3.jpg\" alt=\"mis3\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /> Our Managerial Accounting class.[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1067\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"701\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1067\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mis5.jpg\" alt=\"mis5\" width=\"701\" height=\"960\" /> My consistent group mates hehe[/caption]\n<h1>6. It\'s a requirement for you to be able to teach in the Philippines.</h1>\nIt\'s a plain and simple <a href=\"http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/558203/teachers-at-pasig-university-now-required-to-have-post-graduate-degrees\">requirement </a>in the Philippines. I cannot argue and elaborate more on that. I will write another post about to pros and cons about the vertical articulation by Commission on Higher Education (CHED). Anyway for now, getting a master\'s degree will make you qualified to teach.\n\nI just have to put my disclaimer right away that I know a lot of people who have graduate degrees but incompetent in their fields (and/or don\'t possess the teaching hand). I\'m sorry I just have to say it because there are still a lot who pursue the degree for the \"title\" and \"compliance.\"\n<h1>5. You can build your network of professionals that can help you in your career.</h1>\nOne of my professors in the grad school said that with the variety of students who enroll in the class, he can already build a company with all of us have different roles.I agree with him. Your classmates come from different industries and fields. You can help each other out at work. I have classmates who are in banking, government, project management, academe etc. They can help you look for a job or do your job well. haha\n\nMy professors helped me link to some consulting opportunities which I won\'t be able to find had I not enrolled in grad school. The world in the corporate is quite enclosed that\'s why you need an outlet to spread the network.\n<h1> 4. You get to learn from experiences rather than plain textbooks.</h1>\nMore than the degree, one of the main reasons why I enrolled in grad school is to listen to my classmates and professors\' stories- experiences in work that helped them succeed or even led them to failure. I can read books or Google stuff or even watch tutorials in You Tube. But to listen to the experiences is something you\'ll only get if you\'re in class.\n<h1>3. You have something to look forward after your routinary work.</h1>\nYou will have classmates who still slack in some instances and those who are teacher\'s pets. haha There are also those who study in advance and submit the deliverable very early. You\'ll have classmates who don\'t  have anything to submit too! haha In any case, attending the class is something you will look forward after a week of work. For some, attending a class is a challenge. For others, it is a stress reliever.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1091\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"960\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1091\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mis6.jpg\" alt=\"mis6\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /> The class organized a KTV Christmas Party[/caption]\n<h1>2. You can get promoted at work after you graduate.</h1>\nNot an assurance though. In the government, some posts require a Master\'s degree to lead a division or a department. In the academe, you can get a higher rank.\n\nIn the private sector, I\'ve observed some seasoned managers have master\'s degrees. Most of them have MBA\'s.\n<h1>1. You learn something new.</h1>\nSounds cliché but that\'s the truth. You will have classmates who will take the class just to pass and earn a degree. But majority of my classmates attend class to learn something new. I\'m not a project manager. I have no project management experience but I am learning now (the hard way haha) for our capstone. I need to sell an IT business idea and make sure that I will gain profit. I learned different IS Policy frameworks and how to use them even if I\'m not a manager. And I learned so much more...\n\nHere\'s <a href=\"https://justinpineda.com/2016/07/08/learning-log-1-understanding-human-capital/\">one </a>of the learning logs I wrote in our Human Capital Management class.\n\nIf you think these reasons are what you\'re looking, then enroll now!\n\nI\'m not advertising any school.haha  Just encouraging... :)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;		',	'7 reasons why you should take up a Master\'s degree',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'7-reasons-why-you-should-take-up-a-masters-degree',	'',	'',	'2017-01-07 13:58:46',	'2017-01-07 13:58:46',	'',	0,	'http://justinpineda.com/?p=1030',	0,	'post',	'',	0),
(1128,	1,	'2017-02-19 08:31:16',	'2017-02-19 08:31:16',	'\n				[gallery ids=\"1232,1231\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nRoughly one year after I passed the <a href=\"https://www.giac.org/certification/web-application-penetration-tester-gwapt\">GIAC Web Application Penetration Tester (GWAPT)</a> exam, I took the <a href=\"https://www.giac.org/certification/mobile-device-security-analyst-gmob\">GIAC Mobile Device Security Analyst (GMOB)</a>. I became one of a less than a thousand professionals who earned the certification. One of the observations that I have is that preparations I did for both exams were pretty much the same- from the length of time I studied and the manner I created the index etc.\n\nI decided to write this article to help those people who are planning or studying for any GIAC exam. I also compared my preparation to others who took a different GIAC exam and the results are pretty much the same.\n\nI am providing exam preparations for those who are taking either the SANS boot camp (live) or a SANS on-demand course. I\'m not in the position to provide tips for those taking a challenge exam because I haven\'t tried it. (those who don\'t have any SANS materials and solely rely on their own resources matching the GIAC exam objectives)\n\nSo here it goes...\n<h1>8.Read all the SANS books at least 3 times .</h1>\nI know it\'s quite lengthy and some people have a tendency to just read the chapter summary. But you have to read the books and its entirety. SANS sticks to its course materials. There will be a lot of trick questions along the way but all the questions will come from the course materials.So if you miss the details, then you miss the opportunity to answer it. Believe me, the summary won\'t exactly tell you the specific directory where that certain Trojan hides the file.  You need to have read it.\n\nAlso, based on my my experience, almost 50-50 of the questions in exam are theoretical and application questions. The exam won\'t only check if you know how to use the tools. It will also check if you understood why, when and where to use them. These things will be explained in the books.\n\nWhy read the books at least 3 times? The first time you read the materials, I\'m sure it\'s going to be information overload. But it will give you a grasp of the width and depth of the exam. You will be able to scope your study. You can start using post-its to mark the chapters of the books. The second time you read, you will give time to understand the lessons in the materials. You may start doing your index that time. The third time you read the materials, you it will refresh you with the things you already know and you can get back to the topics you might have missed.\n<h1>7.Do all the lab exercises and explore the other functionalities of the tools.</h1>\nWhen you go to the SANS training, you will be receiving a USB containing all the tools and lab environment that you need. You need to do all the lab exercises. Some of the tools might be familiar to you like Wireshark, Cain, Whois etc. Do the exercises still because depending on the course, the tools may be used in a different way.\n\nAlso, be aware of the tools that are introduced in the book but don\'t have any lab exercises. There are questions that will ask you about that tool and you need to have an idea how to use it.\n\nAnd don\'t expect questions that ask for the same commands or actions that were used in the lab exercises. The exam will give a different scenario using different commands and functionalities of the tool. So it\'s best to explore the functionalities of the tool other than the things that were given in the exercise.\n<h1>6.Create your index for the topics.</h1>\nAs you would know, GIAC exams are open notes. And usually in class, the exams that are open notes are not easy exams. haha You might be tempted to skip the study and search the answers in the books during exam. That\'s not good at all. You only have approximately 1.5 minutes to answer an item in the exam.\n\nOne of the traditional ways to do it is through creating your index of the topics and tools. It can be done in MS Word or MS Excel depending on your need. You can even use a notebook to write down the notes handwritten.\n\nThe goal of the index is to help you recall what the specific details in that topic are. There should be a short description about it and a reference on what book, chapter and page you can find more information about it.\n\nThe goal of the index is not to copy paste the contents in the book in a different paper. That won\'t be helpful. Just summarize the topic and write the reference where you can find it.\n\nIdeally, your index should be around 3-5 pages long.\n<h1>5.Create another index for the tools.</h1>\nWhen you study for the exam, you will be studying and using around 100+ tools. It\'s also best to create index indicating specifically the purpose of the tool is, the known commands, the interface type (GUI or CLI) and for what platform/s it can run.\n\nYou can put reference to the page of the book as well if that tool has a lot of notable very long commands.\n<h1>4.Set a date for your exam so you will be motivated to study.</h1>\nYou have four (4) months  after the training or initial subscription to take the exam. Personally, I think that\'s already a long time. With this type of time frame, you might have the notion thinking that you have a lot of time. To avoid this type of thinking, set the exam in advance so that you will be motivated (and forced) to study to meet that deadline.\n\nAlso, don\'t schedule the exam very late like setting it up on the last day that you can possibly take the exam. Provide a buffer because unavoidable incidents might happen like typhoons or flooding in the Philippines can disrupt the operations of exam centers. (or other personal issues like sickness etc) You will have to pay additional fees if you will take the exam beyond the 4-month period.\n\nAlso, GIAC allows rescheduling of exam at least 24-hours prior from the actual date of the exam. Providing a buffer will give you a time to reschedule for free.\n<h1>3.Treat the Practice Tests like it\'s the actual exam.</h1>\nSANS will provide you two (2) practice tests that simulate the certification exam. The questions there will show you the way they ask questions in the actual exam. Personally, I think the tuning point for your review is when you take the first practice test. It will tell you exactly afterwards in what exam domains you need to improve on.\n\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Important note:</strong> </span>Treat the practice tests like the actual tests. In my experience, I took the practice tests free from any work or pressure. I took the practice test after I rested well. I also took the practice test in a closed room with proper ventilation and lighting, similar to the actual testing center.\n\nYou can opt to choose to see the explanation of the wrong answers or all the answers. My default choice is to <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">show the explanation of all the answers.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Another important note:</strong> </span>Don\'t expect that the questions in the practice tests will appear in the exam. These practice tests will only provide you the feeling of taking the exam. You will be disappointed if you will just memorize the questions thinking that these will appear in the actual exam. haha\n<h1>2.Go to the Exam Center at least an hour early with your books, index and exam permit.</h1>\nResearch very well about the Exam Center where you will be taking your exam. Check the online forum and see what people say about the exam center. Remember, that\'s where you will be taking the <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">$1,000 USD exam</span>! It has to be able to provide the best environment for you that day. I have been taking my exam in <a href=\"https://www.trendsnet.com.ph/\">TrendsNet</a> in Makati. The building is already old and the elevators are slow but the exam center is newly renovated. The exam rooms are comfortable, quiet and clean. There\'s no parking area so whenever I take the exam, it\'s either I take a taxi, Uber or park the car in the mall. The staff is very accommodating and friendly. They are familiar how to handle GIAC exams.\n\nYou need to be in the Exam Center early because they are strict with the time slots you have reserved to. It is better to be early than late. They won\'t allow you to take the exam if you\'re late and you  need to pay a penalty of around <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">$150</span>.\n\nIt pays to be early because it will give you time to relax and take time to go to the restroom and do your last minute preparations. The exam center will also permit you to take the exam early if there are free slots that time.\n<h1>1.Pray hard and find time to relax.</h1>\nI\'m not religious but I find time to pray, talk to God and ask for guidance. Praying gives me a positive vibe. I also find time to relax after a study time like having a massage, eating ice cream etc. haha These small things help me take things positively. Praying and relaxing surely helped me in passing the exam.\n\nThese are some of the things that you can do to prepare for the exam.I hope these tips will help!\n\nGood luck for those who are studying/ will be taking the exam soon.\n\nFor those who have taken the exam, what are your exam preparation tips? :)		',	'8 Helpful Things You can do to Prepare and Pass a GIAC exam',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'8-helpful-things-you-can-do-to-prepare-and-pass-a-giac-exam',	'',	'',	'2017-02-19 08:31:16',	'2017-02-19 08:31:16',	'',	0,	'http://justinpineda.com/?p=1128',	0,	'post',	'',	2),

(1420,	1,	'2017-09-12 16:32:24',	'2017-09-12 16:32:24',	'\n				After teaching in college for more than 5 years, I can summarize the lessons I’ve learned. I realized that the lessons can only be ‘learned’ through experience.\n<ol>\n	<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Teaching is complicated.</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\nThey say teaching is a profession that creates all other professions. Her students may become future scientists, engineers, lawyers, CEO’s even terrorists or politicians. That’s why the skillset required for somebody to become a teacher is complex.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA teacher must be intelligent. She must have a mastery of her specialization. However, an intelligent teacher doesn’t necessarily equate to a good teacher. It complicates things because I met and even sat on classes whose teachers are intelligent yet the class hates them very much. It reflects in the evaluation and the outcome of the class (high mortality rate, students drop when he’s the teacher etc.) Interestingly, they have thick CV’s with outstanding academic and even industry qualifications.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd I experienced that. In my first year of teaching, the mortality rate is high, with a passing of 30-40% in my subjects. Students were failing and I didn’t adjust. I realized I was wrong. There’s something wrong with how I handled the class.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>I realized it’s not only important that you are intelligent about your topic. You need to make sure that students understand and appreciate the topic you are teaching. And that’s the most difficult part. </strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI adjusted. There should be games, activities, debate, film viewing. I needed to improve on my voice, visual aids. I put more pictures and less text in the slides. I created handouts and I created my own lab exercises. Later, I got more and more students who pass the course and at the same time, enjoyed the subject. Some even shifted to security, which happens to be my specialization. It’s a fulfilling feeling to see these changes.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"2\">\n	<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Teaching requires a lot of patience.</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\nProfessor Leonida Africa, the school’s in-house teaching formator, emphasized in her seminar with the newbie teachers that students’ appreciation of the lessons take time. Sometimes, the appreciation of what you have taught will only be realized years after graduation- at work or even when the student has already his own family.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI remember I was easily distracted by the students who were not paying attention during the discussion- chatting, looking at the windows, using the computer etc. Then, I was disappointed when they failed the exam and claimed that the lessons were not explained properly. But you vividly remembered that you discussed it and they were not listening attentively.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI realized after that I did the same thing they did back when I was a student. I realized that as I prepare the so-much-effort-handouts that the students will just lose after a week, the students have their own challenges as well. They have other subjects to attend to other than your course. They have deadlines and deliverables too. They have personal or even financial problems to attend to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe teacher must understand that. Years later, I think my patience was already on the borderline of numbness. Kidding aside, explaining things again and giving extra time to help a student out are normal activities that I do now.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n	<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Teaching doesn’t end after the paid hours.</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\nThis is true especially for part-timers like me. Part-timers are only paid per hour of class time. So, let’s say you have a 4-hour class in a week, then you are paid for 4 hours. The time you spend to prepare for your lesson is not paid. The time you spend to check the test papers is not paid. The time that students spend for consultation about the course is not paid.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut I’m not throwing this against the school or students. To say the least, there are things that money cannot buy. Money cannot buy the love and passion for teaching. I’m not even sure how the school can quantify its value fairly. 😊\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI’m not singling out part-timers. Full-timers experience it too. Especially when teachers entertain and answer students during the weekends or in the middle of the night when the deadline of the project is on the next day. And so much more.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI must emphasize the time because I work full time in the industry. Normally, we are paid during work hours only and we don’t (and are not allowed to) work afterwards unless there is an OT pay.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"4\">\n	<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Teachers don’t discriminate based on grades.</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\nSimilar to my realization # 1, it is the duty of the teacher to ensure that the student understands the lesson. Teachers should not be contented if somebody gets a perfect score in the exam if there are some who failed it miserably. You should investigate further and determine why they failed and what help you can provide.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne essential realization about this was given to me by my immediate superior and Dean, Ms. Rhea Valbuena in one of our casual talks. I was amazed and challenged at the same time with what she said. She said (non-verbatim) that there’s not much problem with teaching “A” (top) students. Whether or not the teacher teaches, the “A” student will remain an “A” student. A great teacher can transform a “C” student to an “A” student.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom then on, I paid attention to those who might need me more. I checked on those who were frequently absent or tardy and talked to them. Those who were consistently getting low grades in the exercises were given more reinforcements- additional readings and seat works to catch up. I adapted the learning log system that I learned from my teachers in the graduate school, Mr. Jerald De La Rosa and Mr. Josefiel Javier where they can write their experience, insights and challenges in the course. Later, we can both track the progress.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"5\">\n	<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Teachers are adaptable to the culture and environment.</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\nIn relation again with realization #1, one of the complexities of being a teacher is being adaptable to the culture and environment. For instance, the shift from teaching a senior class to a freshmen class is not easy. There are concepts that you expect they know but they innocently do not. Freshmen classes are relatively noisier and careless. So, you must adapt.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt will also be different when you handle a class with mixed irregular students from different years. It will also be different if you are teaching the same course with students taking it the second or third time around.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI experienced teaching a class that I usually handle but the students were full time employees. Some were advanced while some were catching up. The most challenging part was that everybody was older than me.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"6\">\n	<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Teachers are like parents.</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\nTo act like a parent is a huge responsibility. Aside from teaching your students, you must support, take care and at times scold and get angry with them too. Students are like your children. Whatever happens to them will reflect on the type of “parenting” you did.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was proud when I saw some of my former students in the Coca-Cola office elevator one time. They were my colleagues already in the industry!\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"7\">\n	<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Teaching is not for everybody.</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\nWell, after reading the first 6 realizations, I think we can agree that teaching is not for everybody. Again, teaching not only requires the mastery of the subject. The extra effort and time needed are demanding. Lastly, as the saying goes, “Teaching is about the outcome, not the income.” The previous statement cannot be any truer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;		',	'7 Things I learned After 5 Years of Teaching',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'7-things-i-learned-after-5-years-of-teaching',	'',	'',	'2017-09-12 16:32:24',	'2017-09-12 16:32:24',	'',	0,	'https://justinpineda.com/?p=1420',	0,	'post',	'',	3),

Equifax is one of the big four credit rating bureaus in the United States. You can imagine the type of data stored and the gravity of the data breach! The data breach was massive as the current investigations determined that at least 143 million user data were captured including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, address, social security numbers and driver’s licenses.\n\nSpecific details on how to monitor potential fraud and mitigate risks brought about by the data breach can be read in <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/the-equifax-breach-what-you-should-know/\">Krebs on Security </a>while <a href=\"https://securingthehuman.sans.org/blog/2017/09/08/awareness-officers-what-to-communicate-about-the-equifax-hack\">SANS</a> has created a management communication on the data breach. Lastly, a <a href=\"https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/\">consumer update</a> on the cybersecurity incident is maintained by Equifax to provide essential information and assistance.\n\nIn management perspective, the accountability of any untoward incident is on the manager or the executive. Firstly, they are paid way, way more. Secondly, they are the ones doing the decision making for the department. That’s why the role of the manager is crucial during events like a data breach.\n\nNow, there are questions that need to be answered during investigations involving data breach. The basic is, did the company exercise due care and due diligence in implementing the security controls to prevent, detect and mitigate the incident? Initial claims stated that it was a Zero-day vulnerability that cannot be detected. However, it appears that the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-breach-no-excuse/\">Apache Struts vulnerability</a> was already discovered last March 2017 at least 2 months prior the breach occurred. This means the attack could’ve been prevented by following the recommendation from a vulnerability scanner. Another question is, how can massive amounts of data be transported or copied without raising any alarms for anomalous traffic or bandwidth utilization?\n\nThese questions mentioned are some of the major lapses that investigators have observed in the Equifax data breach. Of course, the company will give conservative values to stop the bleeding in their reputation damage.\n\nNow, I could’ve just let the data privacy issue pass because there are a lot of security companies and law enforcement agencies that are conducting their comprehensive investigation about the matter. Yesterday, while I was browsing LinkedIn, I saw a post from a certain CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) of a company in USA where the LinkedIn profile of the Equifax CISO was posted and the undergraduate and graduate degrees (both in Music) were emphasized. The post implies that the reason why Equifax was breached was that the CISO studied Music instead of IT or infosec etc. (Screenshot from <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodlanews.com/equifax-chief-security-officer/\">https://www.hollywoodlanews.com/equifax-chief-security-officer/</a>)\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1426\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/linkedin.png\" alt=\"linkedin\" width=\"735\" height=\"666\" />\n\nThere was a heated discussion below the post that came from various users where majority of them were information security professionals. I scrolled through the discussion and majority were bashing the CISO (like how people do it in Facebook). One commented, “That’s what happens when you sing and dance.” Another commented, “How can you protect the organization with that kind of course.” And the bashing continued.\n\nI sighed and felt really disappointed. Do academic degrees matter when you have so many years of related work experience? It is a fact that non-technical managers look like fools in vendor or department discussions especially during planning and analysis stages. Some of these managers will just Google some jargon words prior to the meeting to have some “inputs.” But these end up terribly.\n\nIt is also a fact that executives are hired because of their soft skills and less of their technical skills. They can sell out something by explaining it in the simplest way possible. Finally, when shit happens, they are the ones that get fired or blamed immediately. Again, that’s the reason why they are paid higher.\n\nGoing back to my point, do academic degrees matter during incidents like massive data breach? Let’s assume that the vulnerability exploited in the attack was a Zero-day. Will it make a difference if the CISO has a PhD in Computer Science compared to a graduate of Music?\n\nBecause it is Zero-day, it cannot be detected and cured. It has not been discovered yet. It will happen even if you have a dozen PhD’s or a SANS certified-filled team. Would it make a difference if the attack happened in Equifax and the CISO was a graduate of Computer Science? Information Technology? Would your comment change from “That’s what happens when you sing and dance” to “Oh crap, he did his best but the attack was just bad?”\n\nDo academic degrees matter when combatting security incidents?\n\nWell for the record, I graduated with a degree in Computer Science and finished my Master’s degree in Information Systems. I also was able to find the same Apache Struts vulnerability in one of my security assessments back in March and I was able to help the development team fix it. But I don’t find anything significant in academic degrees stopping security incidents.\n\nI would rather bet on experiences than academic degrees. We’re not in the academe. This is the industry we’re talking about.\n\nPS\n\nI can no longer access the thread in LinkedIn. It looks like they deleted it after a heated discussion.

(1477,	1,	'2017-11-01 04:22:45',	'2017-11-01 04:22:45',	'An organization’s Password Policy can make life difficult for the employees who are required to follow it.\n\nLet’s say the password policy is this:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"623\">Password Length – at least 8\n\nPassword Complexity – must be alphanumeric with symbols and a capital letter\n\nAccount Lockout – 3\n\nMin. Password Age – 5\n\nMax. Password Age – 30\n\nPassword History – 5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe password must be at least 8 characters long that is composed of mixed alphanumeric and symbols. You will have to change it every 30 days and you cannot repeat the last 5 passwords that you have used. In some organizations, you are even prohibited to use words that are found in the dictionary even if it’s only a portion of the password.\n\nNow, the password policy is helpful to secure the accounts because this type of authentication is considered the weakest. Passwords can be cracked or guessed. That’s why complexity is the key.\n\nHowever, human limitation makes complex passwords more vulnerable than secured. For instance, complex passwords may be hard to remember and users may just write it on a piece of paper. They might use the same password in his personal e-mail to his online bank account. Others will tend to request for a new password or keep on choosing “Forgot Password” every time he/she logs in. Because of the mentioned scenarios, the attack surface for a password attack becomes bigger.\n\nIn modern enterprise, a sub-team of the Information Security department is the Identity and Access Management (IAM). The group handles everything about user access such as passwords, privilege management, Single Sign-On (SSO) etc. Still, relying solely on passwords may not be as secure as it was before.\n\nDifferent security companies or even departments started to become more creative in authenticating users. Others use biometrics while others use IP-based authentication or somebody-you-know (the one that Facebook uses) authentication. There’s not one perfect authentication method but a more secured one- which is implementing Multifactor Authentication (MFA). This type of authentication uses 2 or more kinds of authentication schemes such as:\n\nID and biometric (something that you have and something that you are)\n\nATM and PIN (something that you have and something that you know)\n\nCan we implement two-factor authentication with a password that meets (or even goes beyond) the required policies?\n\nThe answer is to use a password vault. A password vault is an application that stores different passwords for safekeeping. It usually stores the username and the password together with the URL or application where the passwords are used. It also provides password generator so that it can randomly create password based on a given requirement. The password vault is locked by generating key or a master password.\n\n<strong>Password Vaults</strong>\n\nI’m going to share two free password vaults that I’ve been using: Keepass (offline) and Lastpass (online).\n<ol>\n 	<li>Keepass (<a href=\"https://keepass.info/\">https://keepass.info/</a>)</li>\n</ol>\nKeepass is a stand-alone application where you can store your passwords for various accounts. You can add entries manually by providing a Title, User Name, Password, URL and Notes. There is also a Password Generator that can provide you random characters that fit for the password requirements.\n\n<u>Pros:</u>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Free and lightweight</li>\n 	<li>Organized and simple</li>\n 	<li>More secured</li>\n 	<li>Limited to your implementation</li>\n</ul>\n<u>Cons:</u>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Not good in mobility</li>\n 	<li>It is static. You need to manually update the entries.</li>\n 	<li>No recovery of master password.</li>\n</ul>\n[caption id=\"attachment_1480\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"624\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1480\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/1-PV.png\" alt=\"1-PV\" width=\"624\" height=\"305\"> Keepass stored credentials list[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1481\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"488\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1481\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2-PV.png\" alt=\"2-PV\" width=\"488\" height=\"509\"> Adding an entry[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1482\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"488\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1482\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/3-PV.png\" alt=\"3-PV\" width=\"488\" height=\"564\"> Random password generator feature[/caption]\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>Lastpass (<a href=\"https://www.lastpass.com/\">https://www.lastpass.com/</a>)</li>\n</ol>\nSimilar to Keepass, Lastpass is another password vault. The only difference is that Lastpass is actually a web browser add-on. It works when you install the add-on and sign-up using your e-mail account. The e-mail is actually your login credentials to the password vault. You can manually add entries in Lastpass or it can automatically add entries when you log in a specific website. It can also automatically supply credentials when the recorded website is detected to login. All password updates are automatically reflected in the database. Furthermore, it also has a “Generate Password” feature similar to Keepass. Most important of all, you can implement MFA in Lastpass.\n\n<u>Pros</u>:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Flexible and user-friendly application.</li>\n 	<li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) can be implemented to complement Lastpass security.</li>\n 	<li>Lost master password can be recovered</li>\n 	<li>Can automatically save user credentials.</li>\n</ul>\n<u>Cons</u>:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Wider attack surface since it can be loaded anywhere just by signing in.</li>\n 	<li>Less secured compared to Keepass.</li>\n 	<li>Limited during online communication.</li>\n 	<li>Relevant known online vulnerabilities can affect the application’s security.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1483\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"624\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1483\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/4-PV.png\" alt=\"4-PV\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"> Lastpass UI in web browser. Extension button at the upper right part.[/caption]\n\n<strong>Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)</strong>\n\nBuying an RSA token for personal use may not be the most practical solution in implementing MFA. SMS may be a good solution but delays in sending notification may affect performance. A real-time OTP generator may be the best solution.\n\nThere are a lot of OTP authenticator apps available. You can check on each and determine which app is compatible to the websites you are using.\n\nI’ve been using Google Authenticator and Lastpass Authenticator for my OTP to complete my MFA. Both of these apps support a wide range of applications. For web applications that support MFA, you can enable it in the settings and choose Authenticator. Usually, the default choice is sending OTP through SMS. Afterwards, the Authenticator will scan a QR code of the web application using the camera of your smartphone to sync. The account for the application will automatically be added in the Authenticator.\n\nIt is important to enable MFA when possible to increase security of the accounts. I also enable MFA in Lastpass password vault to ensure that there are layers of authentication prior from accessing all of my stored credentials.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1484\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"485\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1484\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5-PV.png\" alt=\"5-PV\" width=\"485\" height=\"419\"> Sample synced accounts in Google Authenticator using an Android Phone[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Conclusion </strong>\n\nPassword Vault is important and helpful application in handling your accounts. Because of the complexity of password policies and the wide availability of password cracking tools, it is essential to generate complex and random passwords. However, the limitation is that the complexity is limited with how human brains can handle it. The answer to this dilemma is a password vault. Both offline and online password vaults have its advantages and its disadvantages. For my actual application, I use offline password vault for server management while I use online password vault for web applications.\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) is now a feature in most of the websites that we are using. Several authenticator apps can be synced with our web applications to add an additional layer of security after providing a password. It is highly encouraged to enable the MFA feature for web apps that handle critical data.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;',	'Using a Password Vault and Enabling OTP',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'using-a-password-vault-and-enabling-otp',	'',	'',	'2019-03-07 02:31:39',	'2019-03-07 02:31:39',	'',	0,	'https://justinpineda.com/?p=1477',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

Enrolling in training centers to enhance your knowledge is expensive; and 2. Trainers who give these training courses are underpaid. In 2017, I envisioned providing training services that are way cheaper compared to the mainstream training centers but of outstanding quality. At the same time, trainers who teach the courses get paid double than what they get on the mainstream training centers. That\'s when the idea of Pineda Cybersecurity came to life.\n\nI processed all the necessary permits from DTI, Mayor\'s Office and BIR. I secured various permits to operate. I created a course for ISO 27002 Foundation, which I am certified, printed the materials and boosted Facebook Ads to market the course. The first participants were mostly from the academe. Then the news spread and market increased. Participants from the industry and government also enrolled in the succeeding courses.\n\nMy goal is simple: Teach what you know best and spread the word. Trainers who teach are all from the SME\'s in industry which gives the participants an assurance that the content and delivery are high-quality.\n\nAnd the journey continues...

The tipping point was when I still inhaled smoke going out of the elevator together with my wife and my 3-week old baby boy. I was so angry I threatened to sue the Property Management for negligence in enforcing its policies. I got a reply and they suspended one of their employees after their investigation.\n\nI\'ve been more vocal against smoking when my wife got pregnant and later on when my first child was born.  That\'s why as much as I do not want any confrontation, I tell those who smoke in no-smoking areas to put it out or I report them to the authorities.\n\nA couple of months ago, we hired a nanny in preparation for the coming of our baby. I fired her in less than a week after finding out that she was smoking in the condo unit. For me, smoking when you\'re supposed to take care of the baby is non-negotiable. So I had to let her go.\n\nWhen my wife and I were in Aklan, we were waiting for the airport to open at 12m.n. because it\'s not 24-hour airport. There was a passenger who started smoking in the waiting area. I politely approached him and told him it\'s a no-smoking area. He stopped smoking.\n\nJust this weekend, we stayed in an Airbnb-type condo unit in Tagaytay. While sleeping, I smelled cigarette smoke coming in the unit. I saw people from the adjacent unit smoking in the terrace. I reported it to the guard. But when the smoking spree continued, I had to confront them. They followed and stopped smoking.\n\nShould I be thankful that these people have been penalized or stopped when I told them that it is wrong to smoke in no-smoking place?\n\nShould people reach to a \'motivated phase\' (like having a baby to protect) first to exert effort and provide action against these smokers?\n\nShould there be effort to take action in the first place?\n\nVarious research and statistics have linked lung cancer and cigarette smoking. [1] There are also studies linking passive smokers (second hand smokers) and lung cancer. [2]\n\nThat\'s why I\'m really wondering why it should be the non-smokers who should adjust and exert effort in reminding smokers where to smoke.\n\nAnd the trend is rampant everywhere- you can see smokers in schools, park, police station, hospitals etc. There is an existing law, Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003 (RA 9211). [3] But it seems that there is very little effort in enforcing it. Or may people think it is less priority compared to drugs, murder and so on?\n\nI do not condemn smokers\' right to smoke. A lot of my co-workers smoke and even some of my relatives. However, this \'freedom\' is not absolute. The sad part is, we have created (and allowed) a culture that allows this freedom to harm others even if there are boundaries and safeguards set.\n\nI remember when my granduncle told me that he started smoking in his 20\'s. He is already 70 (and still smoking, unfortunately!) and he doesn\'t have lung cancer while his friend who is a non-smoker just died of lung cancer. His conclusion was that smoking does NOT lead to lung cancer.\n\nThe irony.\n\nAnyway...\n\nI will not stop reminding, confronting and fighting to put smokers in their proper place. Because there is! They just have to look for the designated smoking area.\n\nI\'m still hopeful that there will come a time when non-smokers won\'t have to cover the noses while walking or confront or report smokers in non-smoking places.\n\nGoing back to the suspended employee in our condo because of my complaint, should I pity about the poor guy who won\'t receive a day\'s pay? Should the condo resort to more humane means of penalizing the offender?\n\nThis is not only for the suspended employee but to all those who openly smoke in non-smoking places-\n\nIs there a way for passive smokers to un-inhale the smoke that they have inhaled?\n\nWho should be given pity now? Or in better need of justice?\n\n[1] http://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/lung-cancer/resource-library/lung-cancer-fact-sheet.html\n\n[2] http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/smoking-and-cancer/passive-smoking\n\n[3] http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2003/06/23/republic-act-no-9211/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;		',	'Passive Smoker: Is there justice in inhaling cigarette smoke?',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'passive-smoker-is-there-justice-in-inhaling-cigarette-smoke',	'',	'',	'2018-06-17 20:29:10',	'2018-06-17 12:29:10',	'',	0,	'https://justinpineda.com/?p=1982',	0,	'post',	'',	0),
(1986,	1,	'2018-06-25 08:59:21',	'2018-06-25 00:59:21',	'\n				I first saw the April 2018 jurisprudence from a co-faculty member shared in Facebook. The 19-page decision with Justice Del Castillo as the ponente, denied the petition of 3 former faculty members of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) who were not reappointed in their position for failure to possess a Master\'s degree. It was the 3rd case I\'ve read on the same subject.[1]\n\nThe other two related decisions are: <em>Herrera-Manaois v. St. Scholastica\'s College</em> &amp; <em>University of the East v. Pepanio</em>. Both cases were also mentioned in the April 2018 decision.\n\nWhy is this an issue for teachers, in general?\n\nThe faculty members who were terminated came from the College of Fine Arts &amp; Design (CFAD). [3] I searched one of the petitioners and found out that he is a known artist whose artworks have made it to the international scene. Assuming that these faculty members are so great and famous in their field, fine arts, as artists, would it matter if they do not possess a master\'s degree? Would it be fair if the university will hire individuals who have graduate degrees in their field yet don\'t have the proven track record and practical experience like those who were fired?\n\nTheir petition was denied by the Supreme Court because there were existing memoranda from CHED (CMO 40-08) and DECS (Order 92 Series of 1992) stating that a master\'s degree is a prerequisite for tenure and permanency. No school or faculty policy can be created contrary to these laws from government agencies that have jurisdiction to regulate schools. As stated in the ponencia, \"CHED Chairman Emmanuel Angeles issued a memorandum addressed to the Presidents of public and private institutions, directing the strict implementation of the minimum qualification for faculty members of undergraduate programs, particularly the Master\'s degree and license requirements as mandated by Memorandum Order 40-08, <strong>\"to ensure the highest qualification of their faculty.\" [2]</strong>\n\nUnfortunately, earning a graduate degree does not automatically ensure the highest qualification of the faculty. Since time immemorial, getting a graduate degree doesn\'t mean you\'re giving the highest qualification in some cases. Going to Computer Science or Information Technology, a lot of very good software developers or even network administrators, for instance, are in in the industry, working on big and complex projects or topologies.\n\nThis does not mean however that the people in the academe are not good. We also have brilliant people in the academe doing big projects or research as well. However, the exposure in the practical or real-world problems can make the professional better by experiencing it first-hand and resolving it with a lot of constraints and limitations (time, cost, service level agreements etc.) Isn\'t hiring these practitioners ensure that schools provide their highest qualification as well?\n\nThis is a similar case with these faculty from UST. Probably they are artists whose motivation is to make art. They are outstanding in their work and they probably don\'t think that getting a graduate degree will make them better. Should CHED exempt these people?\n\nI\'ve experienced and seen first hand on different occasions where faculty members enter the classroom, well-prepared and rehearsed but during the discussions, the contents seemed outdated and out of place when industry students asked innocently tough technology questions.  I\'ve witnessed it both in the undergraduate and graduate school setting where the teacher either has Master\'s degree or a Doctorate degree.\n\nUnfortunately or fortunately, the requirement to have a graduate degree to teach is a law that must be followed. The Supreme Court already set a precedence with its jurisprudence on the matter.\n\nSo, what must be done to ensure that we have faculty members are knowledgeable enough to teach in the higher education if graduate degree alone cannot satisfy it?\n\nI can see two things:\n<ol>\n 	<li><strong>Bridge the gap between the industry and academe.</strong> There has to be continuous collaboration (NOT just for compliance) between industry and academe. There is already an initiative from CHED and DOST and I think the industry should reciprocate in the same intensity withthese government agencies. CHED and DOST may have the budget, but the exposure and content will come from the industry. Fortune Top companies can start opening its doors since they too have the budget and resources to do that.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Create more excellent professional graduate programs that can cater to working professionals who eventually would like to teach.</strong> There are still few schools who offer worker-friendly graduate programs. Some schools have so many remedial and elective courses (in some cases relevant for the students but in some cases, it\'s only milking from the students\' pockets)  that will not motivate the students to finish because of the cost and time to finish the degree. The academe should be more creative on creating suitable yet comprehensive courses that will be beneficial for the working students. That will give these industry professionals to share their knowledge from the industry to students in the university.</li>\n</ol>\nIn the same jurisprudence, the court ruled that both parties (faculty members and UST) are in <em>pari delicto</em>, or in equal fault. The faculty members knew that a graduate degree is required and UST knew that they should not be hiring them in the first place. Maybe there is a scarcity of faculty members or the nature of these faculty members is <em>sui generis.</em> UST has its own reason but the court will interpret the law as it is.\n\nI taught in college for 5 years as part-timer, without a master\'s. The college allowed me to stay after seeing my performance with high rating both from the administration and students\' evaluation. The school even sent me to present research papers locally and abroad. But at the end of the day, I realized that I need to earn that Master\'s degree if I would like to teach in the future full-time (since I\'m working in the industry full-time) and because no matter what effort I do, there will be no regularization or promotion because I didn\'t comply with the requirements by the law.\n\nAnd so I finished my Master\'s. Now, I meet the minimum requirements set by CHED.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/pdf/web/viewer.html?file=/jurisprudence/2018/april2018/211273.pdf\n\n[2]  http://ched.gov.ph/cmo-40-s-2008/\n\n[3] http://varsitarian.net/news/20180614/supreme-court-favors-ust-in-faculty-tenureship-dispute		',	'Two things we can do to improve the quality of teachers after the SC ruling on Son et al vs. UST',	'\n						',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'two-things-we-can-do-to-improve-the-quality-of-teachers-after-the-sc-ruling-on-son-et-al-vs-ust',	'',	'',	'2018-06-25 08:59:21',	'2018-06-25 00:59:21',	'',	0,	'https://justinpineda.com/?p=1986',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

(2080,	1,	'2019-03-06 07:46:44',	'2019-03-06 07:46:44',	'For this entry, I consider this much of a social issue because a school is a microcosm of a country or the outside world so to speak.\n\nThis is not an attack towards the members of the academe who try to implement guiding rules and regulations to put standards in the education. This is just a wake up call to the people who are on top of the academic ladder. This is for those who should be protecting the sanctity of quality education one school has to offer. While I\'m not an excellent student with regard to my grades (which the system itself forced me not to believe that intelligence is not based on academic merits), it is ad hominem to say that I\'m not capable of pinpointing mishaps on overlooked academic practices.\n\n<strong>High Grades = I\'m intelligent </strong>\n\nOf my more than four years stay in the University, I found and met different professors, of ranks, age, specialization etc. I have witnessed how they teach. Some are strict. Some are passionate. Some are lenient. &nbsp;Some are diligent. Some don\'t care. &nbsp;Some are lazy. Some don\'t teach. If you\'re to ask a student regarding preferences on professor, he will probably say that he likes a professor who can easily be talked to and quite lenient and a person who gives high grades. That\'s what the students want mostly. They tend to avoid those strict may it be regarding attendance or in academic requirements. They want to learn maybe not too much and pass or get high grades easily. This is a typical observation that can be inferred as a person or student who prioritizes his survival in school and will do anything to remain standing.\n\nAs I mentioned, I don\'t really believe that grades are the basis of your intelligence. It\'s just numbers although it is a key factor somewhat. Still, these are just numbers. I remember when I was in fourth year HS when our very remarkable academic institution was preparing for its 30th year anniversary. They were seeking students to perform in a musical play in the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo for its foundation day. Of course, since it was an academic institution, we all focused on academics. So there were a few who wanted to become part of this musical event. But the much misplaced cunning of the school administration, they decided to \"award\" &nbsp;those people who will join the musical play rehearsals instead of studying. It was a big play so practice for it would take months. If a student joins the musical play, there will be additional points to be given in subjects such as science, math English etc. Other non-academic requirements need not to be passed anymore because of exemption. A lot of students took that offer where you won\'t study yet you\'re going to get high grades. Amazing isn\'t it? There were a few of us who stayed and continued to get the education we deserved. But the teachers were also part of the musical play and teaching us was quite an additional load. Hence, they canceled the classes so why teach? They stopped teaching and said to wait until those CCP partcipants finish their play before they can start teaching again so that we all get the education we deserve without a few getting advance. So what did we do during the times when we had to take the class? Just played a lot of games. But during the exams, we needed to take them all. But of course, those who participated in the CCP event got additional points for their hardwork.\n\nWhere is the essence of quality education then based on academic merit?\n\nLater on I realized that the give-me-grade-so-I-can-be-called-intelligent is a pandemic. That\'s why those people who get high grades don\'t really mean that they\'re really intelligent. There\'s always politics in numbers. These things can always be fabricated in that sense.\n\n<strong>School is my second home</strong>\n\nSince a child spends most of his childhood life in school, educators say that the school is a person\'s second home. Interestingly in the Philippines, to get a good second home comes with a price. If you can pay, you get a good second home with nice facilities. Otherwise, just be a good person. Interestingly, a lot of schools try their best to show the goodness of their institution. They invest on facilities and faculty to attract students. Anyway, when I first heard of the Henry Sy Hall that DLSU is planning to build, I smiled because of the facility that school will build to cater services for the students. But when I learned that a \"mall\" will be built in the midst of the university, I really got literally angry. The school or the sponsor will spend P1.4 billion for a 15-floor building. What are the contents of that building? Study areas? Classrooms? etc etc. These facilities are already existing in the first place. And what will happen to the existing facilities that are overlapped? Destroy it? My goodness. This action now questions the motives of the school. Dr. Nuncio commented on my FB status and said \"Edifice complex.\" And for me it\'s the right term that describes what the school is doing. I won\'t further elaborate on my arguments versus the school\'s plan on erecting a very expensive building. But the bottomline, isn\'t the building just for aesthetics? I again remembered my high school when they decided to build a big chapel. We were all asking the admin to first provide a gym because it can be used everyday by all students. But they decided to build a big chapel for first Friday masses and baccalaureate masses. Edifice complex.\n\n<strong>Teachers are powerful. Students are not.</strong>\n\nIn La Salle, when it is time for class and the student comes in late, he is marked late. When a student misses a classes, he gets zero for the day. When a student uses his cellphone and is caught while in class, he is sent to Discipline Office and gets penalize. But when the mentioned scenarios are made by the professor, nothing bad happens to him. When you try to fight for your right, your respondent professor is avenged by his professor friend and tries to get back to you to another class you are taking. This is reality and this is true. There are a lot of complaints of biased professors who grade low on papers whose opinions oppose theirs even if they say that there are no right or wrong answers. But what can the students do? Complain then what? There is no equality between teachers and students because they are distinct. However the powerful can be abusive. The powerless if not treated equally is always oppressed. It\'s very easy for a professor to give a 0.0 than for a student to have his professor get fired for his incompetency and unbecoming of a faculty.\n\n<strong>My school is popular. Yours is where the hell is that?</strong>\n\nAccording to the modern philosopher Foucault in his writing \"Questions on Geography\", he explained the vital role of a location in getting power. In relation to schools, it\'s the same concept. When a regular student from DLSU applies for a work and then a student from Zamboanga Polytechnic University who graduated Magna Cum Laude applies for the same position, the job will be more likely given to the Lasallian. That\'s true and we have to face it. But for me, I\'ve been in La Salle and saw the imperfections of the school. Many times, I realize that it\'s still up to the person to prove himself that he is rightful and worthy for the position he is aiming for and not the school. But it\'s hard still especially if you came from some never before heard school.\n\n<strong>Cogito Ergo Sum</strong>\n\nAll those misused symbolisms of education I mentioned are just realities that we face. But there are a lot more. The principles, however, of these things are still essential. Grades really check how you fare in a particular topic. Schools really need good facilities to provide good education. There is really a clear distinction between a teacher and a student. Quality schools stand out against those who don\'t perform best. The problem is, these things are exaggerated very much and misuse. What happens? The purpose of it becomes nonsense. People who are in higher learning should review these things and do something about it. I\'m no expert in education. I\'m just a victim of these scenarios and maybe a lot of people too. But as what I\'m seeing now is to be like St. La Salle- a man who dedicated his life for education. If all the teachers are like St. La Salle, there won\'t be grade-bribes or overly-expensive facilities or even abusive professors or discriminating schools. Everything will be as expected: fair, happy, conducive for learning and simple.\n\n<strong>\n</strong>',	'Talk shit in academe etiquette',	'\n						',	'inherit',	'closed',	'closed',	'',	'44-revision-v1',	'',	'',	'2019-03-06 07:46:44',	'2019-03-06 07:46:44',	'',	44,	'http://178.128.63.151/juystinpineda/2019/03/06/44-revision-v1/',	0,	'revision',	'',	0),

Password Age – 5\n\nMax. Password Age – 30\n\nPassword History – 5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe password must be at least 8 characters long that is composed of mixed alphanumeric and symbols. You will have to change it every 30 days and you cannot repeat the last 5 passwords that you have used. In some organizations, you are even prohibited to use words that are found in the dictionary even if it’s only a portion of the password.\n\nNow, the password policy is helpful to secure the accounts because this type of authentication is considered the weakest. Passwords can be cracked or guessed. That’s why complexity is the key.\n\nHowever, human limitation makes complex passwords more vulnerable than secured. For instance, complex passwords may be hard to remember and users may just write it on a piece of paper. They might use the same password in his personal e-mail to his online bank account. Others will tend to request for a new password or keep on choosing “Forgot Password” every time he/she logs in. Because of the mentioned scenarios, the attack surface for a password attack becomes bigger.\n\nIn modern enterprise, a sub-team of the Information Security department is the Identity and Access Management (IAM). The group handles everything about user access such as passwords, privilege management, Single Sign-On (SSO) etc. Still, relying solely on passwords may not be as secure as it was before.\n\nDifferent security companies or even departments started to become more creative in authenticating users. Others use biometrics while others use IP-based authentication or somebody-you-know (the one that Facebook uses) authentication. There’s not one perfect authentication method but a more secured one- which is implementing Multifactor Authentication (MFA). This type of authentication uses 2 or more kinds of authentication schemes such as:\n\nID and biometric (something that you have and something that you are)\n\nATM and PIN (something that you have and something that you know)\n\nCan we implement two-factor authentication with a password that meets (or even goes beyond) the required policies?\n\nThe answer is to use a password vault. A password vault is an application that stores different passwords for safekeeping. It usually stores the username and the password together with the URL or application where the passwords are used. It also provides password generator so that it can randomly create password based on a given requirement. The password vault is locked by generating key or a master password.\n\n<strong>Password Vaults</strong>\n\nI’m going to share two free password vaults that I’ve been using: Keepass (offline) and Lastpass (online).\n<ol>\n 	<li>Keepass (<a href=\"https://keepass.info/\">https://keepass.info/</a>)</li>\n</ol>\nKeepass is a stand-alone application where you can store your passwords for various accounts. You can add entries manually by providing a Title, User Name, Password, URL and Notes. There is also a Password Generator that can provide you random characters that fit for the password requirements.\n\n<u>Pros:</u>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Free and lightweight</li>\n 	<li>Organized and simple</li>\n 	<li>More secured</li>\n 	<li>Limited to your implementation</li>\n</ul>\n<u>Cons:</u>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Not good in mobility</li>\n 	<li>It is static.

The only difference is that Lastpass is actually a web browser add-on. It works when you install the add-on and sign-up using your e-mail account. The e-mail is actually your login credentials to the password vault. You can manually add entries in Lastpass or it can automatically add entries when you log in a specific website. It can also automatically supply credentials when the recorded website is detected to login. All password updates are automatically reflected in the database. Furthermore, it also has a “Generate Password” feature similar to Keepass. Most important of all, you can implement MFA in Lastpass.\n\n<u>Pros</u>:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Flexible and user-friendly application.</li>\n 	<li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) can be implemented to complement Lastpass security.</li>\n 	<li>Lost master password can be recovered</li>\n 	<li>Can automatically save user credentials.</li>\n</ul>\n<u>Cons</u>:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Wider attack surface since it can be loaded anywhere just by signing in.</li>\n 	<li>Less secured compared to Keepass.</li>\n 	<li>Limited during online communication.</li>\n 	<li>Relevant known online vulnerabilities can affect the application’s security.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1483\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"624\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1483\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/4-PV.png\" alt=\"4-PV\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"> Lastpass UI in web browser. Extension button at the upper right part.[/caption]\n\n<strong>Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)</strong>\n\nBuying an RSA token for personal use may not be the most practical solution in implementing MFA. SMS may be a good solution but delays in sending notification may affect performance. A real-time OTP generator may be the best solution.\n\nThere are a lot of OTP authenticator apps available. You can check on each and determine which app is compatible to the websites you are using.\n\nI’ve been using Google Authenticator and Lastpass Authenticator for my OTP to complete my MFA. Both of these apps support a wide range of applications. For web applications that support MFA, you can enable it in the settings and choose Authenticator. Usually, the default choice is sending OTP through SMS. Afterwards, the Authenticator will scan a QR code of the web application using the camera of your smartphone to sync. The account for the application will automatically be added in the Authenticator.\n\nIt is important to enable MFA when possible to increase security of the accounts. I also enable MFA in Lastpass password vault to ensure that there are layers of authentication prior from accessing all of my stored credentials.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1484\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"485\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1484\" src=\"https://justinpineda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5-PV.png\" alt=\"5-PV\" width=\"485\" height=\"419\"> Sample synced accounts in Google Authenticator using an Android Phone[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Conclusion </strong>\n\nPassword Vault is important and helpful application in handling your accounts. Because of the complexity of password policies and the wide availability of password cracking tools, it is essential to generate complex and random passwords. However, the limitation is that the complexity is limited with how human brains can handle it. The answer to this dilemma is a password vault. Both offline and online password vaults have its advantages and its disadvantages. For my actual application, I use offline password vault for server management while I use online password vault for web applications.\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) is now a feature in most of the websites that we are using. Several authenticator apps can be synced with our web applications to add an additional layer of security after providing a password.
